you really love her, you should let her go.\\nIf not, then it\\'s not love.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with someone you don\\'t love getting married?\\nStop this, and go back to the base as a real man.\\nA person like you should learn more about love.\\nIf we want to learn, then we should keep living.\\nDamn it.\\nShe\\'s the nicest girl I\\'ve met.\\nHey!\\nDon\\'t let her go.\\nGot it?\\nIf you do, I\\'ll take her.\\n- Can I go?\\n- Go.\\nScrew it.\\nShit!\\nDon\\'t know.\\nThank you.\\nToday\\'s my birthday.\\nI\\'ll live on until I learn what love is.\\nWhat?\\nWe\\'re just friends?\\nNo, I

one?\\n- Why?\\nDon\\'t wanna read it?\\nShe may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.\\nLooks fun.\\nI\\'ll read it.\\nThis time it\\'s a martial arts film.\\nThe heroine is a bounty hunter.\\nThe villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.\\nThe worst of his kind.\\nWhat happened?\\nHis name\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nGyeon-woo?\\nThe story\\'s setting is a mess.\\nJapan invades during

from her for a long time.\\n- Hello?\\n- Gyeon-woo, it\\'s me.\\nLong time no see.\\nHer voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.\\nOur 100th day celebration is soon.\\nIt\\'s 100 days already?\\nWhen do you think a girl\\'s the prettiest?\\nWhen a sexy woman is naked.\\nWhere are you now?\\nStay right there.\\nNo, I\\'m just kidding.\\nThe prettiest is when she\\'s playing the piano.\\nWhat\\'s your favorite song?\\nThat George Winston song.\\nPachelbel Canon?\\nYeah, that song.\\nYou\\'re not gonna ask me?\\nWhen is the guy the prettiest?\\nJust give me a rose.\\nStill have your high school uniform?\\nYeah.\\nWhy?\\nBring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.\\nDo it yourself, okay?\\nWhat?\\nWhat did you say?\\nHow can I during class?\\nHey!\\nJust hung up on me!\\nDamn it!\\nI don\\'t wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women\\'s college.\\nOh, my God!\\nA burglar!\\nHelp, a burglar!\\nEh?\\nAre you crazy?\\nYou\\'re gonna break into where?\\nWhat on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?\\nAnd you...\\nWhy you didn\\'t drop by your aunt\\'s, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?\\nYou never know how much hard time I went through for you.\\nShe even intends to introduce a girl to you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nWhere are you going?\\nI\\'m cleverer than I look.\\nThese girls sure love Chinese food.\\nHey, you!\\nWhere you headed?\\nCome here!\\nI\\'m delivering Chinese food.\\nI ordered it.\\nBring it here.\\nReally?\\nBring a lot of radish?\\nOh, I forgot something!\\nGive me the food first!\\nThat\\'s the wrong way!\\nThere\\'s another customer.\\nHey!\\nBut that wasn\\'t enough for her.\\nWe relived our old high school days.\\nDrink!\\nDrink till die!\\nI\\'ve never had anything like this.\\nGee!\\nSorry, I\\'m gonna drink it in my way.\\nFeeling so good!\\nHave a smoke, too!\\nWow, I\\'ve never had a smoke, either!\\nGonna be a big deal.\\nI don\\'t smoke well...\\nWhat are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?\\nIt\\'s a suspension!\\nYou\\'ve already had your ups and downs in life.\\nNot to worry.\\nGo ahead and smoke!\\nHey, you are such a tough cookie!\\nYou go to a very good school!\\nThese clothes are so tight!\\nAfter we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.\\nBut she got wasted again.\\nOh, wild teens!\\nHere\\'s a condom.\\nLet\\'s prevent AIDS.\\nTaxi!\\nShe\\'s having a happy dream.\\nCompared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.\\nCould her pain be cured now?\\nMaybe it means that she doesn\\'t need me anymore.\\nExcuse me.\\nCan you drive slowly?\\nHere.\\nHave any plans after graduation?\\nActually, I\\'ve never thought about it yet.\\nCan I see what\\'s in your pocket?\\nSir?\\nRight.\\nIt\\'s a condom.\\nWhat is this for?\\nOh, right.\\nI learned that it prevents AIDS.\\nBut I haven\\'t used it yet.\\n- Actually, on the way here.\\n- Forget it.\\n\"Chicks Hen\"?\\nWhat does this mean?\\nOh, right.\\nIt\\'s a chicken soup restaurant.\\n\"We\\'ll satisfy all your wishes?\"\\nI think it\\'s to satisfy our tastes.\\n\"Hurry and tell him.\"\\nHow do feel about our daughter?\\nOh, right.\\nWe\\'re just friends now.\\nPlease, don\\'t worry.\\nIf we get closer, I\\'ll let you know, sir.\\nDon\\'t see her any more.\\nAfter that day, she never calls me.\\nIt was sudden, but that\\'s how we broke up.\\nWe\\'ve broken up.\\nNow, I\\'m free.\\nIt\\'s me.\\nCome to the cafe by seven o\\'clock.\\nWhy?\\nWhat?\\nI have a blind date today.\\nCome in 45 minutes.\\nI have a blind date, too.\\nAre you on your way?\\nI\\'m on a date with a girl.\\nHurry up.\\nI have to go to the bathroom.\\n\"Gotta go to the bathroom.\"\\nEh?\\nNice to meet you.\\nI\\'m Cha Seok-won.\\nNice to meet you.\\n- Same here.\\n- Have a seat.\\nWere you really with a girl?\\nNo, I was with a guy.\\nCan I take your order?\\nCoffee, please.\\nYou can drink coke.\\nI\\'ll drink coffee.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou\\'re very lucky.\\nI heard a lot about you.\\nThat you\\'re a close friend.\\nFriend...\\nI need to go to the bathroom.\\nHow is he?\\nNo idea... but he looks nice.\\nHe is not the man you broke up with, is he?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhen you see a new man...\\nForget about the past, all right?\\nHow the hell do you know?\\nThis necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, isn\\'t it?\\nYou wouldn\\'t wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.\\nConsidering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn\\'t get over him.\\nDoes that mean he isn\\'t here anymore in this world.\\nThat man is the one my mom introduced to me.\\nShe kept pushing me to meet him...\\nDoesn\\'t look bad, does he?\\nYes.\\nHey, listen!\\nI\\'m totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.\\nA man likes something more feminine.\\nAnd... don\\'t drink a lot.\\nSome of the guys target intoxicated girls.\\nAnd it\\'s all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once don\\'t try to win.\\nGood luck to you.\\nWhere\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nHe left already.\\nHe told me ten rules to follow.\\nI have a good memory.\\nI\\'ll recite them.\\nFirst, don\\'t ask her to be feminine.\\nAnd don\\'t...\\nSecond, don\\'t let her drink over three glasses.\\nShe\\'ll beat someone.\\nAt a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.\\nIf she hits you, act like it hurts.\\nIf it hurts, act like it doesn\\'t.\\nOn your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.\\nShe\\'ll like it a lot.\\nMake sure you learn fencing and squash.\\nAlso, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.\\nIf she says she\\'ll kill you... don\\'t take it lightly.\\nYou\\'ll feel better.\\nIf her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.\\nFinally, she likes to write.\\nEncourage her.\\nLadies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...\\nGyeon-woo.\\nStep back behind the yellow line...\\nGyeon-woo!\\nafter passengers getting off, take in order...\\nGyeon-woo!\\n...please, use the next train.\\nWhat\\'s his name?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI\\'ll do it myself.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nWhere are you?\\nI looked all over for you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nCome to the escalator.\\nOkay?\\nYou\\'re dead if you don\\'t.\\nHurry up.\\nWho told you to hug me?\\nDummy.\\nYou\\'re supposed to dodge.\\nSometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don\\'t.\\nWe\\'re definitely standing at the crossroad now.\\nWhat\\'s going on between us?\\nCan this relationship last forever?\\nWho is it?\\nIt\\'s me, dad.\\nShe told me to write a letter and bring it.\\nTo write it on paper.\\nTo express my feelings,\\nI tried hard to find the right words.\\nWhen I first met her,\\nI wanted to cure her grief, but now I can not give her up.\\nI wish we can get serious.\\nI\\'m writing about these feelings.\\nShe\\'s probably writing about me now.\\nThis is how we\\'re preparing to split up.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nSee that mountain top?\\nYeah.\\nCould someone hear me from there?\\nYes, probably so.\\nOr probably not.\\nThen go over there.\\nI\\'ll shout here.\\nIf you hear, answer me.\\nYou want me to go over there?\\nYeah.\\nGyeon-woo?\\nCan you hear me?\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI really can not help it.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI\\'m sorry...\\nI can not help it.\\nI thought I was different, but I\\'m just a helpless girl.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nDid you bring your letter?\\nYeah.\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nA time capsule.\\nWe put our letters in it and bury it here.\\nAnd two years later, let\\'s meet here again.\\nWe\\'ll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.\\nThis was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn\\'t long.\\nLet\\'s open this exactly two years later, at two.\\nOkay?\\nWe can meet two years later.\\nWhen we meet then, we\\'ll be different from what we are now.\\nWe may become closer, or stay forever apart.\\nWe can only choose one.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou go first.\\nLet\\'s separate here.\\nShould we go together?\\nNo, I\\'ll take the next train.\\nI think that\\'s better.\\nSee you two years later!\\nOkay, in two years!\\nTwo years!\\nBye!\\nGyeon-woo!\\nThat\\'s how we broke up.\\nOvertime\\nI couldn\\'t endure the loneliness after we broke up.\\nThinking of those memories,\\nI started to write about our stories on the Internet.\\nThen I made up my mind.\\nIf I meet her again, I\\'ll show her a different me.\\nGot to make use of my time.\\nFor her and my future\\'s sake.\\nWhy does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?\\nI wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.\\nYup!\\nExcuse me.\\nI wrote \"My Sassy Girl\".\\nShin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.\\nI made her dream come true instead.\\nI wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.\\nShe didn\\'t come.\\nIt\\'s our only day to meet.\\nNo one knows when she will come.\\nWow!\\nHow did he get in here?\\nIt\\'s a mystery.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nHow are you?\\nI was so happy while being with you.\\nI\\'m not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.\\nThe day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.\\nActually, I tried to look for him in you.\\nI know it was wrong.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI also met him on the subway like you.\\nI was really sick at that time.\\nHe did everything I wanted.\\nLike you did to me.\\nUnder this tree, we planned our future together.\\nBut he suddenly passed away.\\nWhile I was dating you, I met his mother often.\\nShe wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn\\'t.\\nThe day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.\\nTo let me free.\\nWhen I met you, this occurred to me.\\nThat maybe... he introduced you to me.\\nBut the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.\\nThe more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.\\nWhile the two of us are apart,\\nI want to forget him alone.\\nAfter that day, I went often to this place.\\nIf I\\'m not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.\\nHow much will we change after two years?\\nI feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.\\nI want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.\\nWhy are you staring at me, sir?\\nBecause you\\'re so pretty.\\nI thought an angel came down.\\nDo you come here often?\\nSometimes.\\nThis tree has a secret.\\nI have a secret here, too.\\nReally?\\nThree years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.\\nWhat\\'s your secret?\\nSo what happened?\\nWe promised to read the letters a year ago.\\nBut I couldn\\'t come.\\nI guess you\\'re a year late.\\nBut two years didn\\'t seem that long.\\nI haven\\'t made any decision yet.\\nI just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.\\nLike what?\\nIf we were destined to meet,\\nI thought we\\'d meet by chance somewhere.\\nKnow what fate is?\\nBuilding a bridge of chance for someone you love.\\nTo be honest, I read you guys letters.\\nI said this tree had a secret, right?\\nYes.\\nLook closely.\\nDoes this tree look the same as before?\\nWell, it looks like it changed a bit.\\nBut I\\'m not sure.\\nPeople are dead or alive.\\nThere\\'s a dead tree and a living tree, too.\\nThis tree was struck dead by lightning last year.\\nIt was split into two.\\nBut this young man felt sorry for it.\\nDuring this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.\\nWhen he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.\\nHe said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.\\nGyeon-woo...\\nYou call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.\\nPlease, call again.\\nHi.\\nIt\\'s been a while.\\nYou\\'ve gotten prettier.\\nYou still look young.\\nHow have you been?\\nYou were in England?\\nYes.\\nFor one and a half years.\\nSo I can forget him.\\nI see.\\nFeel better?\\nYes.\\nA lot better.\\nIs it true now?\\nMy son might be sad.\\nHe won\\'t.\\nHe\\'ll like it this way.\\nGood, that\\'s what I really hoped.\\nAuntie!\\nI was getting my photo taken.\\nYou naughty boy.\\nKnow how long it\\'s been?\\nSorry I didn\\'t tell you before.\\nThis is Gyeon-woo.\\nDoesn\\'t he resemble him?\\nWhen you had a hard time,\\nI tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.\\nHeard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?\\nGo out with him.\\nI thought he\\'d make things easy for you.\\nOh, yeah.\\nGyeon-woo, you\\'re going to England, right?\\nShe\\'s already been there, so she can give you some tips.\\nI don\\'t have to go now.\\nWhy?\\nYou two know each other?\\nYou may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.\\nFrom your future.\\nThis is how I met her again.\\nThink it\\'s too coincidental?\\nIt\\'s building a bridge of chance for your love.\\nPresented by IM Pictures\\nProduced by Shin Cine\\nIn association with MVP Venture Capital and Cinema

make me smile like this.\\n*^____________.^*\\nGot it?\\nI got it.\\nPhew!\\nHer birthday.\\nIf I prepare nothing, she may murder me.\\nI have a good idea.\\nBefore going to the service, I worked in a theme park.\\nSo this is my plan.\\nAt midnight, I\\'ll be alone with her in the park.\\nIt\\'ll be completely dark all around us.\\nOne by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.\\nI raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.\\nThen all the lights turn on and it moves.\\nThere\\'s fireworks, too.\\nIsn\\'t it fantastic?\\nShe\\'ll be thrilled.\\nI gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.\\n- Jump over here?\\n- Yeah.\\nWe have to.\\nI always wanted to come here at night.\\nIt\\'s my birthday, not yours.\\nPlease, let\\'s just try.\\nI\\'ll go up first and help you.\\nEh?\\nThere\\'s a step here.\\nTake my hand.\\nOh, shit!\\nShit!\\nGyeon-woo.\\nHey!\\nAnswer me.\\nI\\'m leaving.\\nI\\'m leaving.\\nAnswer me!\\nGyeon-woo!\\nYou\\'re dead.\\nWait till I catch you.\\nWhy didn\\'t you answer?\\nWanna die?\\nCome with me!\\nHurry and get in.\\nShut up!\\nGo in fast.\\nMove it.\\nSit here.\\nIf you\\'re loud, I\\'ll kill you.\\nGot it?\\nYes.\\n- Answer quietly!\\n- Yes.\\nIs that a real gun?\\n- Wanna see?\\n- Forget it.\\nHow are you two related?\\nWe\\'re just friends.\\nReally?\\nYou mean she could be my pussy?\\nWhat?\\nYour pussy?\\nI\\'m not a cat or anything!\\nGo ahead and apologize!\\nAlright.\\nI\\'ll do it.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nAnyway, friends come here late at night?\\nWhy are you here?\\nWe just wanted to come here at night.\\n- Tell me the truth, idiot.\\n- Nothing special.\\nBullshit.\\nWhat makes you trust a guy like him?\\nI trusted myself.\\nI had a girlfriend, too.\\nShe visited me every week for one year.\\nI was so happy.\\nBut that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.\\nI found out the fact after he was discharged.\\nDamn it.\\nWhile I\\'m in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.\\nMy Yorkshire terrier.\\nBitch.\\nFuck.\\nI came out to kill both bitches.\\nFuck.\\nI have the worst luck in this world.\\nDamn it.\\nKnow what special day is it today?\\nHuh, damn it?\\nThis sucks!\\nHey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?\\nDon\\'t know.\\nHeard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.\\nYeah, the hole in your head is this big.\\nThat\\'s serious.\\nA teeny bullet does that?\\nYeah, the bullet tears the...\\nHey!\\nWhat are you two doing?\\nStop joking around.\\nDamn it.\\nDamn it!\\nEven you bastards ignore me.\\n- That\\'s why you shouldn\\'t be foolish.\\n- Why?\\nAm I foolish?\\nEven if you do this, she will not come back.\\nI know.\\nI know, too.\\nBut if I die, she\\'ll be heartbroken.\\nShe\\'ll never be the same.\\nYou\\'re wrong.\\nThe pain goes away sooner than you think.\\nYou went through something like this?\\nYeah.\\nIt happens that way.\\nDamn it.\\nIf I\\'m caught, I\\'ll go to the can.\\nI\\'ll always think of her there.\\nWhat does \"can\" mean?\\nIt means prison.\\n- Don\\'t interrupt.\\n- Sorry.\\nAnyway, you\\'re responsible for your actions now.\\nExcuse me, sir.\\nHow about letting her go?\\nIf I say no?\\nThen let me go, instead.\\nCome to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.\\nYou act like him, too.\\nYou can go.\\nAnd you...\\nWe die together.\\nGot it?\\nPardon?\\nHey, lady.\\nForget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.\\nGot it?\\n- Go!\\n- Let\\'s go together.\\nAll three of us.\\nWill you leave if I kill him?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nDon\\'t worry too much.\\nThis soldier isn\\'t a bad guy.\\nYou\\'ll come out safely.\\nYou\\'re leaving me alone?\\nThere\\'s no other way.\\nI was afraid to die alone, but I\\'m glad we\\'re in it together.\\nOh, right.\\nOver there, there\\'s an exit near the merry-go-round.\\nNobody knows about it.\\nI used to work here.\\nReally?\\nYou\\'re not tricking me, right?\\nI\\'m a man, too.\\nWhy would I?\\nWalk in front of me.\\nSee?\\nI told you so.\\nThis way!\\nShit!\\nWhat\\'s going on?\\nIt\\'s Gyeon-woo.\\nScrew you!\\nDon\\'t come closer!\\nI\\'ll kill him!\\nI\\'ll really kill him!\\nTell that bitch to come!\\nSo she can see me die!\\nI\\'ll give you an hour!\\nIf not, I\\'ll kill him, and myself, too!\\n- Got it?\\n- Hurry up!\\nSniper 2!\\nThe hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.\\nDon\\'t!\\nWait!\\nDon\\'t shoot!\\nHey, soldier!\\nI mean... sir!\\nYour girlfriend changed her mind, right?\\nDid you really love her?\\nAsk yourself.\\nI think you didn\\'t.\\nIf you really love her, you should let her go.\\nIf not, then it\\'s not love.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with someone you don\\'t love getting married?\\nStop this, and go back to the base as a real man.\\nA person like you should learn more about love.\\nIf we want to learn, then we should keep living.\\nDamn it.\\nShe\\'s the nicest girl I\\'ve met.\\nHey!\\nDon\\'t let her go.\\nGot it?\\nIf you do, I\\'ll take her.\\n- Can I go?\\n- Go.\\nScrew it.\\nShit!\\nDon\\'t know.\\nThank you.\\nToday\\'s my birthday.\\nI\\'ll live on until I learn what love is.\\nWhat?\\nWe\\'re just friends?\\nNo, I said that to save you.\\n\"Let me go, instead?\"\\nWanted to save yourself, huh?\\nHe wouldn\\'t have let you go.\\nStop lying!\\nStop lying!\\nStop lying!\\nHave a nice life alone.\\nI screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.\\n\\'Cause I\\'m proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.\\nI hope you believe in me.\\nYou can not?\\nWait...\\nSecond Half\\nI remember.\\nShe always came with him until last year.\\nWas it last spring or winter?\\nOne day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.\\nTo not let anyone sit in his seat that day.\\nWhat\\'s up?\\nOh, hi.\\nYou\\'re early.\\nI was in the neighborhood.\\nMiss me?\\nOf course!\\nShe always tried hard to look cheery.\\n- I like her that way.\\n- What would you like?\\nCoke, please.\\nWanna die?\\nDrink coffee.\\nTwo coffees, please.\\nI know her.\\nShe pretends to be happy, but she\\'s full of sorrow inside.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nWhat are you smiling at?\\nNo.\\nIt\\'s nothing.\\nLooks fun, huh?\\n- Another one?\\n- Why?\\nDon\\'t wanna read it?\\nShe may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.\\nLooks fun.\\nI\\'ll read it.\\nThis time it\\'s a martial arts film.\\nThe heroine is a bounty hunter.\\nThe villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.\\nThe worst of his kind.\\nWhat happened?\\nHis name\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nGyeon-woo?\\nThe story\\'s setting is a mess.\\nJapan invades during King Sejong\\'s reign, and the King\\'s father is the tyrant Yeonsan.\\nIn the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.\\nHeavy rain pours down on a sunny day.\\nYup!\\nThe heroine becomes a King.\\nKing Jung-jo.\\nShe\\'s from the future, of course.\\nIt\\'s fun, huh?\\nWhy is the heroine always from the future?\\nScience is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.\\nAnd people go to the past to travel.\\nPeople from the future could be here now.\\nI think UFOs are time machines.\\nSomeday, I\\'ll meet someone from the future.\\nI have to.\\nIf you do, ask him to take you.\\nWhat?\\nIf it\\'s possible...\\nGive this to Shin Cine.\\nTell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.\\nJeon Do-yun is okay, too.\\nExcuse me, we talked on the phone, right?\\nWell... this is \"The Warrior\\'s Sad Love Story\"...\\nIt\\'s going to be a hit.\\nShin Cine didn\\'t... call back.\\nHey!\\nHey, kid.\\nIs the subway your sketch book?\\nDon\\'t scribble on it.\\nWanna die?\\nMy lipstick!\\nI always take her home, even to Bupyung station.\\nIt\\'s something a man must do.\\nOn the way, we play fun games, too.\\nLeft foot over the line, I win.\\nWith the right foot, you win.\\nWhat\\'s the prize?\\nLet\\'s see...\\nHow about a kiss?\\nA kiss?\\nWanna die?\\nYou choose.\\nHitting each other.\\nAgain?\\nYou can hit me, too.\\nOkay.\\nSomeone\\'s coming.\\nI think this is unfair.\\nI\\'m a girl, so I\\'ll slap the cheek.\\nNo.\\nThen I\\'ll change it, too.\\n- But I\\'m a girl.\\n- Men and women are equal.\\nOkay, then.\\nYou slap, and I slap, too.\\nGo easy on me, and I\\'ll kill you.\\nBetter slap me on the cheek.\\nIf you don\\'t, I\\'ll kill you!\\nAll right.\\nYou slap, and I\\'ll use my finger.\\nRight, that\\'s fair.\\nSaw that?\\nSee that guy step over with his left foot?\\nI had my eyes closed.\\nPlus he came the opposite way.\\nI thought it was this way.\\nShut up.\\nHere they come.\\nLeft foot.\\nLeft foot.\\nIt\\'ll be the right foot.\\nLeft!\\nLeft!\\nSwitch to the right.\\nYou have to hit me?\\nYou know why the sky is blue?\\n\\'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.\\nNope.\\nIt\\'s for me!\\nI want it to be blue.\\nSo, it\\'s blue.\\nYou know why the fire is hot?\\nIt\\'s all for me.\\nI want it to be hot.\\nSo it is.\\nYou know why we have four seasons here in Korea?\\n- Because of you.\\n- That\\'s correct!\\nAnd why you were born here?\\n- It\\'s for me as well.\\n- What?\\nThat\\'s nonsense.\\nI was born before you.\\nYou know the word \"worship\"?\\n\"Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus,\" huh?\\nWell...\\nYeah, I know.\\nSo, get ready!\\nCome here.\\nStay still.\\nWhen I\\'m with her,\\nI never know how the day will turn out.\\nWhat?\\nWhat are you looking at?\\nI quit!\\nIs your face a racket?\\nWhy does the ball always hit my face?\\nIt\\'s strange.\\nI never want to lose a game.\\nSo I play until I win.\\nWait long?\\nJust a teeny bit.\\nMy mom bought me these heels, but they\\'re killing my feet.\\nWant a massage?\\nNo, it\\'s okay.\\nInstead, let\\'s exchange shoes.\\nDon\\'t wanna?\\nHow can a guy wear heels?\\nIt\\'ll fit.\\nBut, I can not...\\nYeah?\\nI see.\\nCome on.\\nI\\'ll buy you some sneakers.\\nForget it.\\nThen wear mine, and I\\'ll carry yours.\\nYou don\\'t understand women.\\nOkay!\\nLet\\'s exchange.\\nReally?\\nWanna know a secret?\\nWhat is it?\\nI don\\'t wear panties on exam day.\\nBut I had one today.\\nCatch me, honey!\\nHey.\\nIf you don\\'t, I\\'ll kill you.\\n- Phew...\\n- Catch me, honey...!\\nStop right there!\\nStop!\\nOut!\\nIt was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.\\nThat\\'s my house.\\nWait.\\nI\\'ll bring you an umbrella.\\nI\\'m okay.\\nI\\'m already wet so I\\'ll just leave.\\nEh?\\nGee...\\nAre you my daughter\\'s boyfriend?\\nYes, sir.\\nHow much do you know about my daughter?\\nNot much...\\nNext time, don\\'t hang out till late.\\nYou don\\'t understand me.\\nWhy\\'d you stand him up?\\nWhat\\'s wrong with him?\\nWhy do you stand guys up?\\nAnd what happened to your heels?\\nWhat\\'s wrong with you?\\nI told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.\\nHe\\'s dumb and has no future.\\nIt\\'s none of your business.\\nWhy is he stupid?\\nYou\\'re stupid so you don\\'t know.\\nWhat has gotten into you?\\nLet me live my own life!\\nAfterwards,\\nI didn\\'t hear from her for a long time.\\n- Hello?\\n- Gyeon-woo, it\\'s me.\\nLong time no see.\\nHer voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.\\nOur 100th day celebration is soon.\\nIt\\'s 100 days already?\\nWhen do you think a girl\\'s the prettiest?\\nWhen a sexy woman is naked.\\nWhere are you now?\\nStay right there.\\nNo, I\\'m just kidding.\\nThe prettiest is when she\\'s playing the piano.\\nWhat\\'s your favorite song?\\nThat George Winston song.\\nPachelbel Canon?\\nYeah, that song.\\nYou\\'re not gonna ask me?\\nWhen is the guy the prettiest?\\nJust give me a rose.\\nStill have your high school uniform?\\nYeah.\\nWhy?\\nBring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.\\nDo it yourself, okay?\\nWhat?\\nWhat did you say?\\nHow can I during class?\\nHey!\\nJust hung up on me!\\nDamn it!\\nI don\\'t wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women\\'s college.\\nOh, my God!\\nA burglar!\\nHelp, a burglar!\\nEh?\\nAre you crazy?\\nYou\\'re gonna break into where?\\nWhat on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?\\nAnd you...\\nWhy you didn\\'t drop by your aunt\\'s, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?\\nYou never know how much hard time I went through for you.\\nShe even intends to introduce a girl to you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nWhere are you going?\\nI\\'m cleverer than I look.\\nThese girls sure love Chinese food.\\nHey, you!\\nWhere you headed?\\nCome here!\\nI\\'m delivering Chinese food.\\nI ordered it.\\nBring it here.\\nReally?\\nBring a lot of radish?\\nOh, I forgot something!\\nGive me the food first!\\nThat\\'s the wrong way!\\nThere\\'s another customer.\\nHey!\\nBut that wasn\\'t enough for her.\\nWe relived our old high school days.\\nDrink!\\nDrink till die!\\nI\\'ve never had anything like this.\\nGee!\\nSorry, I\\'m gonna drink it in my way.\\nFeeling so good!\\nHave a smoke, too!\\nWow, I\\'ve never had a smoke, either!\\nGonna be a big deal.\\nI don\\'t smoke well...\\nWhat are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?\\nIt\\'s a suspension!\\nYou\\'ve already had your ups and downs in life.\\nNot to worry.\\nGo ahead and smoke!\\nHey, you are such a tough cookie!\\nYou go to a very good school!\\nThese clothes are so tight!\\nAfter we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.\\nBut she got wasted again.\\nOh, wild teens!\\nHere\\'s a condom.\\nLet\\'s prevent AIDS.\\nTaxi!\\nShe\\'s having a happy dream.\\nCompared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.\\nCould her pain be cured now?\\nMaybe it means that she doesn\\'t need me anymore.\\nExcuse me.\\nCan you drive slowly?\\nHere.\\nHave any plans after graduation?\\nActually, I\\'ve never thought about it yet.\\nCan I see what\\'s in your pocket?\\nSir?\\nRight.\\nIt\\'s a condom.\\nWhat is this for?\\nOh, right.\\nI learned that it prevents AIDS.\\nBut I haven\\'t used it yet.\\n- Actually, on the way here.\\n- Forget it.\\n\"Chicks Hen\"?\\nWhat does this mean?\\nOh, right.\\nIt\\'s a chicken soup restaurant.\\n\"We\\'ll satisfy all your wishes?\"\\nI think it\\'s to satisfy our tastes.\\n\"Hurry and tell him.\"\\nHow do feel about our daughter?\\nOh, right.\\nWe\\'re just friends now.\\nPlease, don\\'t worry.\\nIf we get closer, I\\'ll let you know, sir.\\nDon\\'t see her any more.\\nAfter that day, she never calls me.\\nIt was sudden, but that\\'s how we broke up.\\nWe\\'ve broken up.\\nNow, I\\'m free.\\nIt\\'s me.\\nCome to the cafe by seven o\\'clock.\\nWhy?\\nWhat?\\nI have a blind date today.\\nCome in 45 minutes.\\nI have a blind date, too.\\nAre you on your way?\\nI\\'m on a date with a girl.\\nHurry up.\\nI have to go to the bathroom.\\n\"Gotta go to the bathroom.\"\\nEh?\\nNice to meet you.\\nI\\'m Cha Seok-won.\\nNice to meet you.\\n- Same here.\\n- Have a seat.\\nWere you really with a girl?\\nNo, I was with a guy.\\nCan I take your order?\\nCoffee, please.\\nYou can drink coke.\\nI\\'ll drink coffee.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou\\'re very lucky.\\nI heard a lot about you.\\nThat you\\'re a close friend.\\nFriend...\\nI need to go to the bathroom.\\nHow is he?\\nNo idea... but he looks nice.\\nHe is not the man you broke up with, is he?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhen you see a new man...\\nForget about the past, all right?\\nHow the hell do you know?\\nThis necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, isn\\'t it?\\nYou wouldn\\'t wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.\\nConsidering your temper... and you... used to say that you couldn\\'t get over him.\\nDoes that mean he isn\\'t here anymore in this world.\\nThat man is the one my mom introduced to me.\\nShe kept pushing me to meet him...\\nDoesn\\'t look bad, does he?\\nYes.\\nHey, listen!\\nI\\'m totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.\\nA man likes something more feminine.\\nAnd... don\\'t drink a lot.\\nSome of the guys target intoxicated girls.\\nAnd it\\'s all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once don\\'t try to win.\\nGood luck to you.\\nWhere\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nHe left already.\\nHe told me ten rules to follow.\\nI have a good memory.\\nI\\'ll recite them.\\nFirst, don\\'t ask her to be feminine.\\nAnd don\\'t...\\nSecond, don\\'t let her drink over three glasses.\\nShe\\'ll beat someone.\\nAt a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.\\nIf she hits you, act like it hurts.\\nIf it hurts, act like it doesn\\'t.\\nOn your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.\\nShe\\'ll like it a lot.\\nMake sure you learn fencing and squash.\\nAlso, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.\\nIf she says she\\'ll kill you... don\\'t take it lightly.\\nYou\\'ll feel better.\\nIf her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.\\nFinally, she likes to write.\\nEncourage her.\\nLadies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...\\nGyeon-woo.\\nStep back behind the yellow line...\\nGyeon-woo!\\nafter passengers getting off, take in order...\\nGyeon-woo!\\n...please, use the next train.\\nWhat\\'s his name?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI\\'ll do it myself.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nWhere are you?\\nI looked all over for you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nCome to the escalator.\\nOkay?\\nYou\\'re dead if you don\\'t.\\nHurry up.\\nWho told you to hug me?\\nDummy.\\nYou\\'re supposed to dodge.\\nSometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I don\\'t.\\nWe\\'re definitely standing at the crossroad now.\\nWhat\\'s going on between us?\\nCan this relationship last forever?\\nWho is it?\\nIt\\'s me, dad.\\nShe told me to write a letter and bring it.\\nTo write it on paper.\\nTo express my feelings,\\nI tried hard to find the right words.\\nWhen I first met her,\\nI wanted to cure her grief, but now I can not give her up.\\nI wish we can get serious.\\nI\\'m writing about these feelings.\\nShe\\'s probably writing about me now.\\nThis is how we\\'re preparing to split up.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nSee that mountain top?\\nYeah.\\nCould someone hear me from there?\\nYes, probably so.\\nOr probably not.\\nThen go over there.\\nI\\'ll shout here.\\nIf you hear, answer me.\\nYou want me to go over there?\\nYeah.\\nGyeon-woo?\\nCan you hear me?\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI really can not help it.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI\\'m sorry...\\nI can not help it.\\nI thought I was different, but I\\'m just a helpless girl.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nDid you bring your letter?\\nYeah.\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nA time capsule.\\nWe put our letters in it and bury it here.\\nAnd two years later, let\\'s meet here again.\\nWe\\'ll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.\\nThis was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years isn\\'t long.\\nLet\\'s open this exactly two years later, at two.\\nOkay?\\nWe can meet two years later.\\nWhen we meet then, we\\'ll be different from what we are now.\\nWe may become closer, or stay forever apart.\\nWe can only choose one.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou go first.\\nLet\\'s separate here.\\nShould we go together?\\nNo, I\\'ll take the next train.\\nI think that\\'s better.\\nSee you two years later!\\nOkay, in two years!\\nTwo years!\\nBye!\\nGyeon-woo!\\nThat\\'s how we broke up.\\nOvertime\\nI couldn\\'t endure the loneliness after we broke up.\\nThinking of those memories,\\nI started to write about our stories on the Internet.\\nThen I made up my mind.\\nIf I meet her again, I\\'ll show her a different me.\\nGot to make use of my time.\\nFor her and my future\\'s sake.\\nWhy does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?\\nI wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.\\nYup!\\nExcuse me.\\nI wrote \"My Sassy Girl\".\\nShin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.\\nI made her dream come true instead.\\nI wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.\\nShe didn\\'t come.\\nIt\\'s our only day to meet.\\nNo one knows when she will come.\\nWow!\\nHow did he get in here?\\nIt\\'s a mystery.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nHow are you?\\nI was so happy while being with you.\\nI\\'m not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.\\nThe day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.\\nActually, I tried to look for him in you.\\nI know it was wrong.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI also met him on the subway like you.\\nI was really sick at that time.\\nHe did everything I wanted.\\nLike you did to me.\\nUnder this tree, we planned our future together.\\nBut he suddenly passed away.\\nWhile I was dating you, I met his mother often.\\nShe wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I couldn\\'t.\\nThe day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.\\nTo let me free.\\nWhen I met you, this occurred to me.\\nThat maybe... he introduced you to me.\\nBut the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.\\nThe more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.\\nWhile the two of us are apart,\\nI want to forget him alone.\\nAfter that day, I went often to this place.\\nIf I\\'m not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.\\nHow much will we change after two years?\\nI feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.\\nI want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.\\nWhy are you staring at me, sir?\\nBecause you\\'re so pretty.\\nI thought an angel came down.\\nDo you come here often?\\nSometimes.\\nThis tree has a secret.\\nI have a secret here, too.\\nReally?\\nThree years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.\\nWhat\\'s your secret?\\nSo what happened?\\nWe promised to read the letters a year ago.\\nBut I couldn\\'t come.\\nI guess you\\'re a year late.\\nBut two years didn\\'t seem that long.\\nI haven\\'t made any decision yet.\\nI just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.\\nLike what?\\nIf we were destined to meet,\\nI thought we\\'d meet by chance somewhere.\\nKnow what fate is?\\nBuilding a bridge of chance for someone you love.\\nTo be honest, I read you guys letters.\\nI said this tree had a secret, right?\\nYes.\\nLook closely.\\nDoes this tree look the same as before?\\nWell, it looks like it changed a bit.\\nBut I\\'m not sure.\\nPeople are dead or alive.\\nThere\\'s a dead tree and a living tree, too.\\nThis tree was struck dead by lightning last year.\\nIt was split into two.\\nBut this young man felt sorry for it.\\nDuring this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.\\nWhen he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.\\nHe said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.\\nGyeon-woo...\\nYou call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.\\nPlease, call again.\\nHi.\\nIt\\'s been a while.\\nYou\\'ve gotten prettier.\\nYou still look young.\\nHow have you been?\\nYou were in England?\\nYes.\\nFor one and a half years.\\nSo I can forget him.\\nI see.\\nFeel better?\\nYes.\\nA lot better.\\nIs it true now?\\nMy son might be sad.\\nHe will not.\\nHe\\'ll like it this way.\\nGood, that\\'s what I really hoped.\\nAuntie!\\nI was getting my photo taken.\\nYou naughty boy.\\nKnow how long it\\'s been?\\nSorry I didn\\'t tell you before.\\nThis is Gyeon-woo.\\nDoesn\\'t he resemble him?\\nWhen you had a hard time,\\nI tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.\\nHeard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?\\nGo out with him.\\nI thought he\\'d make things easy for you.\\nOh, yeah.\\nGyeon-woo, you\\'re going to England, right?\\nShe\\'s already been there, so she can give you some tips.\\nI don\\'t have to go now.\\nWhy?\\nYou two know each other?\\nYou may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.\\nFrom your future.\\nThis is how I met her again.\\nThink it\\'s too coincidental?\\nIt\\'s building a bridge of chance for your love.\\nPresented by IM Pictures\\nProduced by Shin Cine\\nIn association with MVP Venture Capital and Cinema

mind, right?\\nDid you really love her?\\nAsk yourself.\\nI think you did not.\\nIf you really love her, you should let her go.\\nIf not, then it\\'s not love.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with someone you do not love getting married?\\nStop this, and go back to the base as a real man.\\nA person like you should learn more about love.\\nIf we want to learn, then we should keep living.\\nDamn it.\\nShe\\'s the nicest girl I\\'ve met.\\nHey!\\nDo not let her go.\\nGot it?\\nIf you do, I\\'ll take her.\\n- Can I go?\\n- Go.\\nScrew it.\\nShit!\\nDo not know.\\nThank you.\\nToday\\'s my birthday.\\nI\\'ll live

believe in me.\\nYou can not?\\nWait...\\nSecond Half\\nI remember.\\nShe always came with him until last year.\\nWas it last spring or winter?\\nOne day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.\\nTo not let anyone sit in his seat that day.\\nWhat\\'s up?\\nOh, hi.\\nYou\\'re early.\\nI was in the neighborhood.\\nMiss me?\\nOf course!\\nShe always tried hard to look cheery.\\n- I like her that way.\\n- What would you like?\\nCoke, please.\\nWanna die?\\nDrink coffee.\\nTwo coffees, please.\\nI know her.\\nShe pretends to be happy, but she\\'s full of sorrow inside.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nWhat are you smiling at?\\nNo.\\nIt\\'s nothing.\\nLooks fun, huh?\\n- Another one?\\n- Why?\\nDo not wanna read it?\\nShe may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.\\nLooks fun.\\nI\\'ll read it.\\nThis time it\\'s a martial arts film.\\nThe heroine is a bounty hunter.\\nThe villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.\\nThe worst of his kind.\\nWhat happened?\\nHis name\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nGyeon-woo?\\nThe story\\'s setting is a mess.\\nJapan invades during King Sejong\\'s reign, and the King\\'s father is the tyrant Yeonsan.\\nIn the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.\\nHeavy rain pours down on a sunny day.\\nYup!\\nThe heroine becomes a King.\\nKing Jung-jo.\\nShe\\'s from the future, of course.\\nIt\\'s fun, huh?\\nWhy is the heroine always from the future?\\nScience is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.\\nAnd people go to the past to travel.\\nPeople from the future could be here now.\\nI think UFOs are time machines.\\nSomeday, I\\'ll meet someone from the future.\\nI have to.\\nIf you do, ask him to take you.\\nWhat?\\nIf it\\'s possible...\\nGive this to Shin Cine.\\nTell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and

back.\\nHey!\\nHey, kid.\\nIs the subway your sketch book?\\nDo not scribble on it.\\nWanna die?\\nMy lipstick!\\nI always take her home, even to Bupyung station.\\nIt\\'s something a man must do.\\nOn the way, we play fun games, too.\\nLeft foot over the line, I win.\\nWith the right foot, you win.\\nWhat\\'s the prize?\\nLet\\'s see...\\nHow about a kiss?\\nA kiss?\\nWanna die?\\nYou

before you.\\nYou know the word \"worship\"?\\n\"Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus,\" huh?\\nWell...\\nYeah, I know.\\nSo, get ready!\\nCome here.\\nStay still.\\nWhen I\\'m

shoes.\\nDo not wanna?\\nHow can a guy wear heels?\\nIt\\'ll fit.\\nBut, I can not...\\nYeah?\\nI see.\\nCome on.\\nI\\'ll buy you some sneakers.\\nForget it.\\nThen wear mine, and I\\'ll carry yours.\\nYou do not understand women.\\nOkay!\\nLet\\'s exchange.\\nReally?\\nWanna know a secret?\\nWhat is it?\\nI do not wear panties on exam day.\\nBut I had one today.\\nCatch me,

know.\\nWhat has gotten into you?\\nLet me live my own life!\\nAfterwards,\\nI did not hear from her for a long time.\\n- Hello?\\n- Gyeon-woo, it\\'s me.\\nLong time no see.\\nHer voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.\\nOur 100th day celebration is soon.\\nIt\\'s 100 days already?\\nWhen do you think a girl\\'s the prettiest?\\nWhen a sexy woman is naked.\\nWhere are you now?\\nStay right there.\\nNo, I\\'m just kidding.\\nThe prettiest is when she\\'s playing the piano.\\nWhat\\'s your favorite song?\\nThat George Winston song.\\nPachelbel Canon?\\nYeah, that song.\\nYou\\'re not gonna ask me?\\nWhen is the guy the prettiest?\\nJust give me a rose.\\nStill have your high school uniform?\\nYeah.\\nWhy?\\nBring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.\\nDo it yourself, okay?\\nWhat?\\nWhat did you say?\\nHow can I during class?\\nHey!\\nJust hung up on me!\\nDamn it!\\nI do not wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women\\'s college.\\nOh, my God!\\nA burglar!\\nHelp, a burglar!\\nEh?\\nAre you crazy?\\nYou\\'re gonna break into where?\\nWhat on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?\\nAnd you...\\nWhy you did not drop by your aunt\\'s, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?\\nYou never know how much hard time I went through for you.\\nShe even intends to introduce a girl to you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nWhere are you going?\\nI\\'m cleverer than I look.\\nThese girls sure love Chinese food.\\nHey, you!\\nWhere you headed?\\nCome here!\\nI\\'m delivering Chinese food.\\nI ordered it.\\nBring it here.\\nReally?\\nBring a lot of radish?\\nOh, I forgot something!\\nGive me the food first!\\nThat\\'s the wrong way!\\nThere\\'s another customer.\\nHey!\\nBut that was not enough for her.\\nWe relived our old high school days.\\nDrink!\\nDrink till die!\\nI\\'ve never had anything like this.\\nGee!\\nSorry, I\\'m gonna drink it in my way.\\nFeeling so good!\\nHave a smoke, too!\\nWow, I\\'ve never had a smoke, either!\\nGonna be a big deal.\\nI do not smoke well...\\nWhat are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?\\nIt\\'s a suspension!\\nYou\\'ve already had your ups and downs in life.\\nNot to worry.\\nGo ahead and smoke!\\nHey, you are such a tough cookie!\\nYou go to a very good school!\\nThese clothes are so tight!\\nAfter we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.\\nBut she got wasted again.\\nOh, wild teens!\\nHere\\'s a condom.\\nLet\\'s prevent AIDS.\\nTaxi!\\nShe\\'s having a happy dream.\\nCompared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.\\nCould her pain be cured now?\\nMaybe it means that she does not need me anymore.\\nExcuse me.\\nCan you drive slowly?\\nHere.\\nHave any plans after graduation?\\nActually, I\\'ve never thought about it yet.\\nCan I see what\\'s in your pocket?\\nSir?\\nRight.\\nIt\\'s a condom.\\nWhat is this for?\\nOh, right.\\nI learned that it prevents AIDS.\\nBut I have not used it yet.\\n- Actually, on the way here.\\n- Forget it.\\n\"Chicks Hen\"?\\nWhat does this mean?\\nOh, right.\\nIt\\'s a chicken soup restaurant.\\n\"We\\'ll satisfy all your wishes?\"\\nI think it\\'s to satisfy our tastes.\\n\"Hurry and tell him.\"\\nHow do feel about our daughter?\\nOh, right.\\nWe\\'re just friends now.\\nPlease, do not worry.\\nIf we get closer, I\\'ll let you know, sir.\\nDo not see her any more.\\nAfter that day, she never calls me.\\nIt was sudden, but that\\'s how we broke up.\\nWe\\'ve broken up.\\nNow, I\\'m free.\\nIt\\'s me.\\nCome to the cafe by seven o\\'clock.\\nWhy?\\nWhat?\\nI have a blind date today.\\nCome in 45 minutes.\\nI have a blind date, too.\\nAre you on your way?\\nI\\'m on a date with a girl.\\nHurry up.\\nI have to

a guy.\\nCan I take your order?\\nCoffee, please.\\nYou can drink coke.\\nI\\'ll drink coffee.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou\\'re very lucky.\\nI heard a lot about you.\\nThat you\\'re a close friend.\\nFriend...\\nI need to go to the bathroom.\\nHow is he?\\nNo idea... but he looks nice.\\nHe is not the man you broke up with, is he?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhen you see a new man...\\nForget about the past, all right?\\nHow the hell do you know?\\nThis necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, is not it?\\nYou would not wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.\\nConsidering your temper... and you... used to say that you could not get over him.\\nDoes that mean he is not here anymore in this world.\\nThat man is the one my mom introduced to me.\\nShe kept pushing me to meet him...\\nDoes not look bad, does he?\\nYes.\\nHey, listen!\\nI\\'m totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.\\nA man likes something more feminine.\\nAnd... do not drink a lot.\\nSome of the guys target intoxicated girls.\\nAnd it\\'s all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once do not try to win.\\nGood luck to you.\\nWhere\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nHe left already.\\nHe told me ten rules to follow.\\nI have a good memory.\\nI\\'ll recite them.\\nFirst, do not ask her to be feminine.\\nAnd do not...\\nSecond, do not let her drink over three glasses.\\nShe\\'ll beat someone.\\nAt a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.\\nIf she hits you, act like it hurts.\\nIf it hurts, act like it does not.\\nOn your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.\\nShe\\'ll like it a lot.\\nMake sure you learn fencing and squash.\\nAlso, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.\\nIf she says she\\'ll kill you... do not take it lightly.\\nYou\\'ll feel better.\\nIf her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.\\nFinally, she likes to write.\\nEncourage her.\\nLadies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...\\nGyeon-woo.\\nStep back behind the yellow line...\\nGyeon-woo!\\nafter passengers getting off, take in order...\\nGyeon-woo!\\n...please, use the next train.\\nWhat\\'s his name?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI\\'ll do it myself.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nWhere are you?\\nI looked all over for you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nCome to the escalator.\\nOkay?\\nYou\\'re dead if you do not.\\nHurry up.\\nWho told you to hug me?\\nDummy.\\nYou\\'re supposed to dodge.\\nSometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I do not.\\nWe\\'re definitely standing at the crossroad now.\\nWhat\\'s going on between us?\\nCan this relationship last forever?\\nWho is it?\\nIt\\'s me, dad.\\nShe told me to write a letter and bring it.\\nTo write it on paper.\\nTo express my feelings,\\nI tried hard to find the right words.\\nWhen I first met her,\\nI wanted to cure her grief, but now I can not give her up.\\nI wish we can get serious.\\nI\\'m writing about these feelings.\\nShe\\'s probably writing about me now.\\nThis is how we\\'re preparing to split up.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nSee that mountain top?\\nYeah.\\nCould someone hear me from there?\\nYes, probably so.\\nOr probably not.\\nThen go over there.\\nI\\'ll shout here.\\nIf you hear, answer me.\\nYou want me to go over there?\\nYeah.\\nGyeon-woo?\\nCan you hear me?\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI really can not help it.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI\\'m sorry...\\nI can not help it.\\nI thought I was different, but I\\'m just a helpless girl.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nDid you bring your letter?\\nYeah.\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nA time capsule.\\nWe put our letters in it and bury it here.\\nAnd two years later, let\\'s meet here again.\\nWe\\'ll read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.\\nThis was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years is not long.\\nLet\\'s open this exactly two years later, at two.\\nOkay?\\nWe can meet two years later.\\nWhen we meet then, we\\'ll be different from what we are now.\\nWe may become closer, or stay forever apart.\\nWe can only choose one.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou go first.\\nLet\\'s separate here.\\nShould we go together?\\nNo, I\\'ll take the next train.\\nI think that\\'s better.\\nSee you two years later!\\nOkay, in two years!\\nTwo years!\\nBye!\\nGyeon-woo!\\nThat\\'s how we broke up.\\nOvertime\\nI could not endure the loneliness after we broke up.\\nThinking of those memories,\\nI started to write about our stories on the Internet.\\nThen I made up my mind.\\nIf I meet her again, I\\'ll show her a different me.\\nGot to make use of my time.\\nFor her and my future\\'s sake.\\nWhy does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?\\nI wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.\\nYup!\\nExcuse me.\\nI wrote \"My Sassy Girl\".\\nShin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.\\nI made her dream come true instead.\\nI wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.\\nShe did not come.\\nIt\\'s our only day to meet.\\nNo one knows when she will come.\\nWow!\\nHow did he get in here?\\nIt\\'s a mystery.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nHow are you?\\nI was so happy while being with you.\\nI\\'m not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.\\nThe day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.\\nActually, I tried to look for him in you.\\nI know it was wrong.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI also met him on the subway like you.\\nI was really sick at that time.\\nHe did everything I wanted.\\nLike you did to me.\\nUnder this tree, we planned our future together.\\nBut he suddenly passed away.\\nWhile I was dating you, I met his mother often.\\nShe wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I could not.\\nThe day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.\\nTo let me free.\\nWhen I met you, this occurred to me.\\nThat maybe... he introduced you to me.\\nBut the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.\\nThe more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.\\nWhile the two of us are apart,\\nI want to forget him alone.\\nAfter that day, I went often to this place.\\nIf I\\'m not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.\\nHow much will we change after two years?\\nI feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.\\nI want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.\\nWhy are you staring at me, sir?\\nBecause you\\'re so pretty.\\nI thought an angel came down.\\nDo you come here often?\\nSometimes.\\nThis tree has a secret.\\nI have a secret here, too.\\nReally?\\nThree years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.\\nWhat\\'s your secret?\\nSo what happened?\\nWe promised to read the letters a year ago.\\nBut I could not come.\\nI guess you\\'re a year late.\\nBut two years did not seem that long.\\nI have not made any decision yet.\\nI just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.\\nLike what?\\nIf we were destined to meet,\\nI thought we\\'d meet by chance somewhere.\\nKnow what fate is?\\nBuilding a bridge of chance for someone you love.\\nTo be honest, I read you guys letters.\\nI said this tree had a secret, right?\\nYes.\\nLook closely.\\nDoes this tree look the same as before?\\nWell, it looks like it changed a bit.\\nBut I\\'m not sure.\\nPeople are dead or alive.\\nThere\\'s a dead tree and a living tree, too.\\nThis tree was struck dead by lightning last year.\\nIt was split into two.\\nBut this young man felt sorry for it.\\nDuring this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.\\nWhen he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.\\nHe said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.\\nGyeon-woo...\\nYou call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.\\nPlease, call again.\\nHi.\\nIt\\'s been a while.\\nYou\\'ve gotten prettier.\\nYou still look young.\\nHow have you been?\\nYou were in England?\\nYes.\\nFor one and a half years.\\nSo I can forget him.\\nI see.\\nFeel better?\\nYes.\\nA lot better.\\nIs it true now?\\nMy son might be sad.\\nHe will not.\\nHe\\'ll like it this way.\\nGood, that\\'s what I really hoped.\\nAuntie!\\nI was getting my photo taken.\\nYou naughty boy.\\nKnow how long it\\'s been?\\nSorry I did not tell you before.\\nThis is Gyeon-woo.\\nDoes not he resemble him?\\nWhen you had a hard time,\\nI tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.\\nHeard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?\\nGo out with him.\\nI thought he\\'d make things easy for you.\\nOh, yeah.\\nGyeon-woo, you\\'re going to England, right?\\nShe\\'s already been there, so she can give you some tips.\\nI do not have to go now.\\nWhy?\\nYou two know each other?\\nYou may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.\\nFrom your future.\\nThis is how I met her again.\\nThink it\\'s too coincidental?\\nIt\\'s building a bridge of chance for your love.\\nPresented by IM Pictures\\nProduced by Shin

know.\\nWhat has gotten into you?\\nLet me live my own life!\\nAfterwards,\\nI did not hear from her for a long time.\\n- Hello?\\n- Gyeon-woo, it\\'s me.\\nLong time no see.\\nHer voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.\\nOur 100th day celebration is soon.\\nIt\\'s 100 days already?\\nWhen do you think a girl\\'s the prettiest?\\nWhen a sexy woman is naked.\\nWhere are you now?\\nStay right there.\\nNo, I\\'m just kidding.\\nThe prettiest is when she\\'s playing the piano.\\nWhat\\'s your favorite song?\\nThat George Winston song.\\nPachelbel Canon?\\nYeah, that song.\\nYou\\'re not gonna ask me?\\nWhen is the guy the prettiest?\\nJust give me a rose.\\nStill have your high school uniform?\\nYeah.\\nWhy?\\nBring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.\\nDo it yourself, okay?\\nWhat?\\nWhat did you say?\\nHow can I during class?\\nHey!\\nJust hung up on me!\\nDamn it!\\nI do not wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women\\'s college.\\nOh, my God!\\nA burglar!\\nHelp, a burglar!\\nEh?\\nAre you crazy?\\nYou\\'re gonna break into where?\\nWhat on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?\\nAnd you...\\nWhy you did not drop by your aunt\\'s, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?\\nYou never know how much hard time I went through for you.\\nShe even intends to introduce a girl to you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nWhere are you going?\\nI\\'m cleverer than I look.\\nThese girls sure love Chinese food.\\nHey, you!\\nWhere you headed?\\nCome here!\\nI\\'m delivering Chinese food.\\nI ordered it.\\nBring it here.\\nReally?\\nBring a lot of radish?\\nOh, I forgot something!\\nGive me the food first!\\nThat\\'s the wrong way!\\nThere\\'s another customer.\\nHey!\\nBut that was not enough for her.\\nWe relived our old high school days.\\nDrink!\\nDrink till die!\\nI\\'ve never had anything like this.\\nGee!\\nSorry, I\\'m gonna drink it in my way.\\nFeeling so good!\\nHave a smoke, too!\\nWow, I\\'ve never had a smoke, either!\\nGonna be a big deal.\\nI do not smoke well...\\nWhat are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?\\nIt\\'s a suspension!\\nYou\\'ve already had your ups and downs in life.\\nNot to worry.\\nGo ahead and smoke!\\nHey, you are such a tough cookie!\\nYou go to a very good school!\\nThese clothes are so tight!\\nAfter we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.\\nBut she got wasted again.\\nOh, wild teens!\\nHere\\'s a condom.\\nLet\\'s prevent AIDS.\\nTaxi!\\nShe\\'s having a happy dream.\\nCompared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.\\nCould her pain be cured now?\\nMaybe it means that she does not need me anymore.\\nExcuse me.\\nCan you drive slowly?\\nHere.\\nHave any plans after graduation?\\nActually, I\\'ve never thought about it yet.\\nCan I see what\\'s in your pocket?\\nSir?\\nRight.\\nIt\\'s a condom.\\nWhat is this for?\\nOh, right.\\nI learned that it prevents AIDS.\\nBut I have not used it yet.\\n- Actually, on the way here.\\n- Forget it.\\n\"Chicks Hen\"?\\nWhat does this mean?\\nOh, right.\\nIt\\'s a chicken soup restaurant.\\n\"We will satisfy all your wishes?\"\\nI think it\\'s to satisfy our tastes.\\n\"Hurry and tell him.\"\\nHow do feel about our daughter?\\nOh, right.\\nWe\\'re just friends now.\\nPlease, do not worry.\\nIf we get closer, I will let you know, sir.\\nDo not see her any more.\\nAfter that day, she never calls me.\\nIt was sudden, but that\\'s how we broke up.\\nWe\\'ve broken up.\\nNow, I\\'m free.\\nIt\\'s me.\\nCome to the cafe by seven o\\'clock.\\nWhy?\\nWhat?\\nI have a blind date today.\\nCome in 45 minutes.\\nI have a blind date, too.\\nAre you on your way?\\nI\\'m on a date with a girl.\\nHurry up.\\nI have to go to the bathroom.\\n\"Gotta go to the bathroom.\"\\nEh?\\nNice to meet you.\\nI\\'m Cha Seok-won.\\nNice to meet you.\\n- Same here.\\n- Have a seat.\\nWere you really with a girl?\\nNo, I was with a guy.\\nCan I take your order?\\nCoffee, please.\\nYou can drink coke.\\nI will drink coffee.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou\\'re very lucky.\\nI heard a lot about you.\\nThat you\\'re a close friend.\\nFriend...\\nI need to go to the bathroom.\\nHow is he?\\nNo idea... but he looks nice.\\nHe is not the man you broke up with, is he?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhen you see a new man...\\nForget about the past, all right?\\nHow the hell do you know?\\nThis necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, is not it?\\nYou would not wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.\\nConsidering your temper... and you... used to say that you could not get over him.\\nDoes that mean he is not here anymore in this world.\\nThat man is the one my mom introduced to me.\\nShe kept pushing me to meet him...\\nDoes not look bad, does he?\\nYes.\\nHey, listen!\\nI\\'m totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.\\nA man likes something more feminine.\\nAnd... do not drink a lot.\\nSome of the guys target intoxicated girls.\\nAnd it\\'s all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once do not try to win.\\nGood luck to you.\\nWhere\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nHe left already.\\nHe told me ten rules to follow.\\nI have a good memory.\\nI will recite them.\\nFirst, do not ask her to be feminine.\\nAnd do not...\\nSecond, do not let her drink over three glasses.\\nShe will beat someone.\\nAt a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.\\nIf she hits you, act like it hurts.\\nIf it hurts, act like it does not.\\nOn your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.\\nShe will like it a lot.\\nMake sure you learn fencing and squash.\\nAlso, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.\\nIf she says she will kill you... do not take it lightly.\\nYou will feel better.\\nIf her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.\\nFinally, she likes to write.\\nEncourage her.\\nLadies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...\\nGyeon-woo.\\nStep back behind the yellow line...\\nGyeon-woo!\\nafter passengers getting off, take in order...\\nGyeon-woo!\\n...please, use the next train.\\nWhat\\'s his name?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI will do it myself.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nWhere are you?\\nI looked all over for you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nCome to the escalator.\\nOkay?\\nYou\\'re dead if you do not.\\nHurry up.\\nWho told you to hug me?\\nDummy.\\nYou\\'re supposed to dodge.\\nSometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I do not.\\nWe\\'re definitely standing at the crossroad now.\\nWhat\\'s going on between us?\\nCan this relationship last forever?\\nWho is it?\\nIt\\'s me, dad.\\nShe told me to write a letter and bring it.\\nTo write it on paper.\\nTo express my feelings,\\nI tried hard to find the right words.\\nWhen I first met her,\\nI wanted to cure her grief, but now I can not give her up.\\nI wish we can get serious.\\nI\\'m writing about these feelings.\\nShe\\'s probably writing about me now.\\nThis is how we\\'re preparing to split up.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nSee that mountain top?\\nYeah.\\nCould someone hear me from there?\\nYes, probably so.\\nOr probably not.\\nThen go over there.\\nI will shout here.\\nIf you hear, answer me.\\nYou want me to go over there?\\nYeah.\\nGyeon-woo?\\nCan you hear me?\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI really can not help it.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI\\'m sorry...\\nI can not help it.\\nI thought I was different, but I\\'m just a helpless girl.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nDid you bring your letter?\\nYeah.\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nA time capsule.\\nWe put our letters in it and bury it here.\\nAnd two years later, let\\'s meet here again.\\nWe will read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.\\nThis was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years is not long.\\nLet\\'s open this exactly two years later, at two.\\nOkay?\\nWe can meet two years later.\\nWhen we meet then, we will be different from what we are now.\\nWe may become closer, or stay forever apart.\\nWe can only choose one.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou go first.\\nLet\\'s separate here.\\nShould we go together?\\nNo, I will take the next train.\\nI think that\\'s better.\\nSee you two years later!\\nOkay, in two years!\\nTwo years!\\nBye!\\nGyeon-woo!\\nThat\\'s how we broke up.\\nOvertime\\nI could not endure the loneliness after we broke up.\\nThinking of those memories,\\nI started to write about our stories on the Internet.\\nThen I made up my mind.\\nIf I meet her again, I will show her a different me.\\nGot to make use of my time.\\nFor her and my future\\'s sake.\\nWhy does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?\\nI wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.\\nYup!\\nExcuse me.\\nI wrote \"My Sassy Girl\".\\nShin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.\\nI made her dream come true instead.\\nI wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.\\nShe did not come.\\nIt\\'s our only day to meet.\\nNo one knows when she will come.\\nWow!\\nHow did he get in here?\\nIt\\'s a mystery.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nHow are you?\\nI was so happy while being with you.\\nI\\'m not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.\\nThe day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.\\nActually, I tried to look for him in you.\\nI know it was wrong.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nI also met him on the subway like you.\\nI was really sick at that time.\\nHe did everything I wanted.\\nLike you did to me.\\nUnder this tree, we planned our future together.\\nBut he suddenly passed away.\\nWhile I was dating you, I met his mother often.\\nShe wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I could not.\\nThe day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.\\nTo let me free.\\nWhen I met you, this occurred to me.\\nThat maybe... he introduced you to me.\\nBut the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.\\nThe more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.\\nWhile the two of us are apart,\\nI want to forget him alone.\\nAfter that day, I went often to this place.\\nIf I\\'m not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.\\nHow much will we change after two years?\\nI feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.\\nI want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.\\nWhy are you staring at me, sir?\\nBecause you\\'re so pretty.\\nI thought an angel came down.\\nDo you come here often?\\nSometimes.\\nThis tree has a secret.\\nI have a secret here, too.\\nReally?\\nThree years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.\\nWhat\\'s your secret?\\nSo what happened?\\nWe promised to read the letters a year ago.\\nBut I could not come.\\nI guess you\\'re a year late.\\nBut two years did not seem that long.\\nI have not made any decision yet.\\nI just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.\\nLike what?\\nIf we were destined to meet,\\nI thought we\\'d meet by chance somewhere.\\nKnow what fate is?\\nBuilding a bridge of chance for someone you love.\\nTo be honest, I read you guys letters.\\nI said this tree had a secret, right?\\nYes.\\nLook closely.\\nDoes this tree look the same as before?\\nWell, it looks like it changed a bit.\\nBut I\\'m not sure.\\nPeople are dead or alive.\\nThere\\'s a dead tree and a living tree, too.\\nThis tree was struck dead by lightning last year.\\nIt was split into two.\\nBut this young man felt sorry for it.\\nDuring this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.\\nWhen he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.\\nHe said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.\\nGyeon-woo...\\nYou call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.\\nPlease, call again.\\nHi.\\nIt\\'s been a while.\\nYou\\'ve gotten prettier.\\nYou still look young.\\nHow have you been?\\nYou were in England?\\nYes.\\nFor one and a half years.\\nSo I can forget him.\\nI see.\\nFeel better?\\nYes.\\nA lot better.\\nIs it true now?\\nMy son might be sad.\\nHe will not.\\nHe will like it this way.\\nGood, that\\'s what I really hoped.\\nAuntie!\\nI was getting my photo taken.\\nYou naughty boy.\\nKnow how long it\\'s been?\\nSorry I did not tell you before.\\nThis is Gyeon-woo.\\nDoes not he resemble him?\\nWhen you had a hard time,\\nI tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.\\nHeard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?\\nGo out with him.\\nI thought he\\'d make things easy for you.\\nOh, yeah.\\nGyeon-woo, you\\'re going to England, right?\\nShe\\'s already been there, so she can give you some tips.\\nI do not have to go now.\\nWhy?\\nYou two know each other?\\nYou may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.\\nFrom your future.\\nThis is how I met her again.\\nThink it\\'s too coincidental?\\nIt\\'s building a bridge of chance for your love.\\nPresented by IM Pictures\\nProduced by Shin

yourself.\\nI think you did not.\\nIf you really love her, you should let her go.\\nIf not, then it\\'s not love.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with someone you do not love getting married?\\nStop this, and go back to the base as a real man.\\nA person like you should learn more about love.\\nIf we want to learn, then we should keep living.\\nDamn it.\\nShe\\'s the nicest girl I\\'ve met.\\nHey!\\nDo not let her go.\\nGot it?\\nIf you do, I will take her.\\n- Can I go?\\n- Go.\\nScrew it.\\nShit!\\nDo not know.\\nThank you.\\nToday\\'s my birthday.\\nI will live on until I learn what love is.\\nWhat?\\nWe\\'re just friends?\\nNo, I said that to save you.\\n\"Let me go, instead?\"\\nWanted to save yourself, huh?\\nHe would not have let you go.\\nStop lying!\\nStop lying!\\nStop lying!\\nHave a nice life alone.\\nI screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.\\n\\'Cause I am proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.\\nI hope you believe in me.\\nYou can not?\\nWait...\\nSecond Half\\nI remember.\\nShe always came with him until last year.\\nWas it last spring or winter?\\nOne day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.\\nTo not let anyone sit in his seat that day.\\nWhat\\'s up?\\nOh, hi.\\nYou\\'re early.\\nI was in the neighborhood.\\nMiss me?\\nOf course!\\nShe always tried hard to look cheery.\\n- I like her that way.\\n- What would you like?\\nCoke, please.\\nWanna die?\\nDrink coffee.\\nTwo coffees, please.\\nI know her.\\nShe pretends to be happy, but she\\'s full of sorrow inside.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nWhat are you smiling at?\\nNo.\\nIt\\'s nothing.\\nLooks fun, huh?\\n- Another one?\\n- Why?\\nDo not wanna read it?\\nShe may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.\\nLooks fun.\\nI will read it.\\nThis time it\\'s a martial arts film.\\nThe heroine is a bounty hunter.\\nThe villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.\\nThe worst of his kind.\\nWhat happened?\\nHis name\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nGyeon-woo?\\nThe story\\'s setting is a mess.\\nJapan invades during King Sejong\\'s reign, and the King\\'s father is the tyrant Yeonsan.\\nIn the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.\\nHeavy rain pours down on a sunny day.\\nYup!\\nThe heroine becomes a King.\\nKing Jung-jo.\\nShe\\'s from the future, of course.\\nIt\\'s fun, huh?\\nWhy is the heroine always from the future?\\nScience is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.\\nAnd people go to the past to travel.\\nPeople from the future could be here now.\\nI think UFOs are time machines.\\nSomeday, I will meet someone from the future.\\nI have to.\\nIf you do, ask him to take you.\\nWhat?\\nIf it\\'s possible...\\nGive this to Shin Cine.\\nTell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.\\nJeon Do-yun is okay, too.\\nExcuse me, we talked on the phone, right?\\nWell... this is \"The Warrior\\'s Sad Love Story\"...\\nIt\\'s going to be a hit.\\nShin Cine did not... call back.\\nHey!\\nHey, kid.\\nIs the subway your sketch book?\\nDo not scribble on it.\\nWanna die?\\nMy lipstick!\\nI always take her home, even to Bupyung station.\\nIt\\'s something a man must do.\\nOn the way, we play fun games, too.\\nLeft foot over the line, I win.\\nWith the right foot, you win.\\nWhat\\'s the prize?\\nLet\\'s see...\\nHow about a kiss?\\nA kiss?\\nWanna die?\\nYou choose.\\nHitting each other.\\nAgain?\\nYou can hit me, too.\\nOkay.\\nSomeone\\'s coming.\\nI think this is unfair.\\nI am a girl, so I will slap the cheek.\\nNo.\\nThen I will change it, too.\\n- But I am a girl.\\n- Men and women are equal.\\nOkay, then.\\nYou slap, and I slap, too.\\nGo easy on me, and I will kill you.\\nBetter slap me on the cheek.\\nIf you do not, I will kill you!\\nAll right.\\nYou slap, and I will use my finger.\\nRight, that\\'s fair.\\nSaw that?\\nSee that guy step over with his left foot?\\nI had my eyes closed.\\nPlus he came the opposite way.\\nI thought it was this way.\\nShut up.\\nHere they come.\\nLeft foot.\\nLeft foot.\\nIt will be the right foot.\\nLeft!\\nLeft!\\nSwitch to the right.\\nYou have to hit me?\\nYou know why the sky is blue?\\n\\'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.\\nNope.\\nIt\\'s for me!\\nI want it to be blue.\\nSo, it\\'s blue.\\nYou know why the fire is hot?\\nIt\\'s all for me.\\nI want it to be hot.\\nSo it is.\\nYou know why we have four seasons here in Korea?\\n- Because of you.\\n- That\\'s correct!\\nAnd why you were born here?\\n- It\\'s for me as well.\\n- What?\\nThat\\'s nonsense.\\nI was born before you.\\nYou know the word \"worship\"?\\n\"Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus,\" huh?\\nWell...\\nYeah, I know.\\nSo, get ready!\\nCome here.\\nStay still.\\nWhen I am with her,\\nI never know how the day will turn out.\\nWhat?\\nWhat are you looking at?\\nI quit!\\nIs your face a racket?\\nWhy does the ball always hit my face?\\nIt\\'s strange.\\nI never want to lose a game.\\nSo I play until I win.\\nWait long?\\nJust a teeny bit.\\nMy mom bought me these heels, but they\\'re killing my feet.\\nWant a massage?\\nNo, it\\'s okay.\\nInstead, let\\'s exchange shoes.\\nDo not wanna?\\nHow can a guy wear heels?\\nIt will fit.\\nBut, I can not...\\nYeah?\\nI see.\\nCome on.\\nI will buy you some sneakers.\\nForget it.\\nThen wear mine, and I will carry yours.\\nYou do not understand women.\\nOkay!\\nLet\\'s exchange.\\nReally?\\nWanna know a secret?\\nWhat is it?\\nI do not wear panties on exam day.\\nBut I had one today.\\nCatch me, honey!\\nHey.\\nIf you do not, I will kill you.\\n- Phew...\\n- Catch me, honey...!\\nStop right there!\\nStop!\\nOut!\\nIt was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.\\nThat\\'s my house.\\nWait.\\nI will bring you an umbrella.\\nI am okay.\\nI am already wet so I will just leave.\\nEh?\\nGee...\\nAre you my daughter\\'s boyfriend?\\nYes, sir.\\nHow much do you know about my daughter?\\nNot much...\\nNext time, do not hang out till late.\\nYou do not understand me.\\nWhy\\'d you stand him up?\\nWhat\\'s wrong with him?\\nWhy do you stand guys up?\\nAnd what happened to your heels?\\nWhat\\'s wrong with you?\\nI told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.\\nHe\\'s dumb and has no future.\\nIt\\'s none of your business.\\nWhy is he stupid?\\nYou\\'re stupid so you do not know.\\nWhat has gotten into you?\\nLet me live my own life!\\nAfterwards,\\nI did not hear from her for a long time.\\n- Hello?\\n- Gyeon-woo, it\\'s me.\\nLong time no see.\\nHer voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.\\nOur 100th day celebration is soon.\\nIt\\'s 100 days already?\\nWhen do you think a girl\\'s the prettiest?\\nWhen a sexy woman is naked.\\nWhere are you now?\\nStay right there.\\nNo, I am just kidding.\\nThe prettiest is when she\\'s playing the piano.\\nWhat\\'s your favorite song?\\nThat George Winston song.\\nPachelbel Canon?\\nYeah, that song.\\nYou\\'re not gonna ask me?\\nWhen is the guy the prettiest?\\nJust give me a rose.\\nStill have your high school uniform?\\nYeah.\\nWhy?\\nBring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.\\nDo it yourself, okay?\\nWhat?\\nWhat did you say?\\nHow can I during class?\\nHey!\\nJust hung up on me!\\nDamn it!\\nI do not wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women\\'s college.\\nOh, my God!\\nA burglar!\\nHelp, a burglar!\\nEh?\\nAre you crazy?\\nYou\\'re gonna break into where?\\nWhat on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?\\nAnd you...\\nWhy you did not drop by your aunt\\'s, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?\\nYou never know how much hard time I went through for you.\\nShe even intends to introduce a girl to you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nWhere are you going?\\nI am cleverer than I look.\\nThese girls sure love Chinese food.\\nHey, you!\\nWhere you headed?\\nCome here!\\nI am delivering Chinese food.\\nI ordered it.\\nBring it here.\\nReally?\\nBring a lot of radish?\\nOh, I forgot something!\\nGive me the food first!\\nThat\\'s the wrong way!\\nThere\\'s another customer.\\nHey!\\nBut that was not enough for her.\\nWe relived our old high school days.\\nDrink!\\nDrink till die!\\nI\\'ve never had anything like this.\\nGee!\\nSorry, I am gonna drink it in my way.\\nFeeling so good!\\nHave a smoke, too!\\nWow, I\\'ve never had a smoke, either!\\nGonna be a big deal.\\nI do not smoke well...\\nWhat are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?\\nIt\\'s a suspension!\\nYou\\'ve already had your ups and downs in life.\\nNot to worry.\\nGo ahead and smoke!\\nHey, you are such a tough cookie!\\nYou go to a very good school!\\nThese clothes are so tight!\\nAfter we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.\\nBut she got wasted again.\\nOh, wild teens!\\nHere\\'s a condom.\\nLet\\'s prevent AIDS.\\nTaxi!\\nShe\\'s having a happy dream.\\nCompared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.\\nCould her pain be cured now?\\nMaybe it means that she does not need me anymore.\\nExcuse me.\\nCan you drive slowly?\\nHere.\\nHave any plans after graduation?\\nActually, I\\'ve never thought about it yet.\\nCan I see what\\'s in your pocket?\\nSir?\\nRight.\\nIt\\'s a condom.\\nWhat is this for?\\nOh, right.\\nI learned that it prevents AIDS.\\nBut I have not used it yet.\\n- Actually, on the way here.\\n- Forget it.\\n\"Chicks Hen\"?\\nWhat does this mean?\\nOh, right.\\nIt\\'s a chicken soup restaurant.\\n\"We will satisfy all your wishes?\"\\nI think it\\'s to satisfy our tastes.\\n\"Hurry and tell him.\"\\nHow do feel about our daughter?\\nOh, right.\\nWe\\'re just friends now.\\nPlease, do not worry.\\nIf we get closer, I will let you know, sir.\\nDo not see her any more.\\nAfter that day, she never calls me.\\nIt was sudden, but that\\'s how we broke up.\\nWe\\'ve broken up.\\nNow, I am free.\\nIt\\'s me.\\nCome to the cafe by seven o\\'clock.\\nWhy?\\nWhat?\\nI have a blind date today.\\nCome in 45 minutes.\\nI have a blind date, too.\\nAre you on your way?\\nI am on a date with a girl.\\nHurry up.\\nI have to go to the bathroom.\\n\"Gotta go to the bathroom.\"\\nEh?\\nNice to meet you.\\nI am Cha Seok-won.\\nNice to meet you.\\n- Same here.\\n- Have a seat.\\nWere you really with a girl?\\nNo, I was with a guy.\\nCan I take your order?\\nCoffee, please.\\nYou can drink coke.\\nI will drink coffee.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou\\'re very lucky.\\nI heard a lot about you.\\nThat you\\'re a close friend.\\nFriend...\\nI need to go to the bathroom.\\nHow is he?\\nNo idea... but he looks nice.\\nHe is not the man you broke up with, is he?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhen you see a new man...\\nForget about the past, all right?\\nHow the hell do you know?\\nThis necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, is not it?\\nYou would not wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.\\nConsidering your temper... and you... used to say that you could not get over him.\\nDoes that mean he is not here anymore in this world.\\nThat man is the one my mom introduced to me.\\nShe kept pushing me to meet him...\\nDoes not look bad, does he?\\nYes.\\nHey, listen!\\nI am totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.\\nA man likes something more feminine.\\nAnd... do not drink a lot.\\nSome of the guys target intoxicated girls.\\nAnd it\\'s all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once do not try to win.\\nGood luck to you.\\nWhere\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nHe left already.\\nHe told me ten rules to follow.\\nI have a good memory.\\nI will recite them.\\nFirst, do not ask her to be feminine.\\nAnd do not...\\nSecond, do not let her drink over three glasses.\\nShe will beat someone.\\nAt a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.\\nIf she hits you, act like it hurts.\\nIf it hurts, act like it does not.\\nOn your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.\\nShe will like it a lot.\\nMake sure you learn fencing and squash.\\nAlso, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.\\nIf she says she will kill you... do not take it lightly.\\nYou will feel better.\\nIf her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.\\nFinally, she likes to write.\\nEncourage her.\\nLadies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...\\nGyeon-woo.\\nStep back behind the yellow line...\\nGyeon-woo!\\nafter passengers getting off, take in order...\\nGyeon-woo!\\n...please, use the next train.\\nWhat\\'s his name?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI will do it myself.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nWhere are you?\\nI looked all over for you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nCome to the escalator.\\nOkay?\\nYou\\'re dead if you do not.\\nHurry up.\\nWho told you to hug me?\\nDummy.\\nYou\\'re supposed to dodge.\\nSometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I do not.\\nWe\\'re definitely standing at the crossroad now.\\nWhat\\'s going on between us?\\nCan this relationship last forever?\\nWho is it?\\nIt\\'s me, dad.\\nShe told me to write a letter and bring it.\\nTo write it on paper.\\nTo express my feelings,\\nI tried hard to find the right words.\\nWhen I first met her,\\nI wanted to cure her grief, but now I can not give her up.\\nI wish we can get serious.\\nI am writing about these feelings.\\nShe\\'s probably writing about me now.\\nThis is how we\\'re preparing to split up.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nSee that mountain top?\\nYeah.\\nCould someone hear me from there?\\nYes, probably so.\\nOr probably not.\\nThen go over there.\\nI will shout here.\\nIf you hear, answer me.\\nYou want me to go over there?\\nYeah.\\nGyeon-woo?\\nCan you hear me?\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI am sorry.\\nI really can not help it.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI am sorry.\\nI am sorry...\\nI can not help it.\\nI thought I was different, but I am just a helpless girl.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI am sorry.\\nDid you bring your letter?\\nYeah.\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nA time capsule.\\nWe put our letters in it and bury it here.\\nAnd two years later, let\\'s meet here again.\\nWe will read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.\\nThis was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years is not long.\\nLet\\'s open this exactly two years later, at two.\\nOkay?\\nWe can meet two years later.\\nWhen we meet then, we will be different from what we are now.\\nWe may become closer, or stay forever apart.\\nWe can only choose one.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou go first.\\nLet\\'s separate here.\\nShould we go together?\\nNo, I will take the next train.\\nI think that\\'s better.\\nSee you two years later!\\nOkay, in two years!\\nTwo years!\\nBye!\\nGyeon-woo!\\nThat\\'s how we broke up.\\nOvertime\\nI could not endure the loneliness after we broke up.\\nThinking of those memories,\\nI started to write about our stories on the Internet.\\nThen I made up my mind.\\nIf I meet her again, I will show her a different me.\\nGot to make use of my time.\\nFor her and my future\\'s sake.\\nWhy does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?\\nI wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.\\nYup!\\nExcuse me.\\nI wrote \"My Sassy Girl\".\\nShin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.\\nI made her dream come true instead.\\nI wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.\\nShe did not come.\\nIt\\'s our only day to meet.\\nNo one knows when she will come.\\nWow!\\nHow did he get in here?\\nIt\\'s a mystery.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nHow are you?\\nI was so happy while being with you.\\nI am not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.\\nThe day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.\\nActually, I tried to look for him in you.\\nI know it was wrong.\\nI am sorry.\\nI also met him on the subway like you.\\nI was really sick at that time.\\nHe did everything I wanted.\\nLike you did to me.\\nUnder this tree, we planned our future together.\\nBut he suddenly passed away.\\nWhile I was dating you, I met his mother often.\\nShe wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I could not.\\nThe day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.\\nTo let me free.\\nWhen I met you, this occurred to me.\\nThat maybe... he introduced you to me.\\nBut the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.\\nThe more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.\\nWhile the two of us are apart,\\nI want to forget him alone.\\nAfter that day, I went often to this place.\\nIf I am not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.\\nHow much will we change after two years?\\nI feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.\\nI want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.\\nWhy are you staring at me, sir?\\nBecause you\\'re so pretty.\\nI thought an angel came down.\\nDo you come here often?\\nSometimes.\\nThis tree has a secret.\\nI have a secret here, too.\\nReally?\\nThree years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.\\nWhat\\'s your secret?\\nSo what happened?\\nWe promised to read the letters a year ago.\\nBut I could not come.\\nI guess you\\'re a year late.\\nBut two years did not seem that long.\\nI have not made any decision yet.\\nI just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.\\nLike what?\\nIf we were destined to meet,\\nI thought we\\'d meet by chance somewhere.\\nKnow what fate is?\\nBuilding a bridge of chance for someone you love.\\nTo be honest, I read you guys letters.\\nI said this tree had a secret, right?\\nYes.\\nLook closely.\\nDoes this tree look the same as before?\\nWell, it looks like it changed a bit.\\nBut I am not sure.\\nPeople are dead or alive.\\nThere\\'s a dead tree and a living tree, too.\\nThis tree was struck dead by lightning last year.\\nIt was split into two.\\nBut this young man felt sorry for it.\\nDuring this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.\\nWhen he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.\\nHe said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.\\nGyeon-woo...\\nYou call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.\\nPlease, call again.\\nHi.\\nIt\\'s been a while.\\nYou\\'ve gotten prettier.\\nYou still look young.\\nHow have you been?\\nYou were in England?\\nYes.\\nFor one and a half years.\\nSo I can forget him.\\nI see.\\nFeel better?\\nYes.\\nA lot better.\\nIs it true now?\\nMy son might be sad.\\nHe will not.\\nHe will like it this way.\\nGood, that\\'s what I really hoped.\\nAuntie!\\nI was getting my photo taken.\\nYou naughty boy.\\nKnow how long it\\'s been?\\nSorry I did not tell you before.\\nThis is Gyeon-woo.\\nDoes not he resemble him?\\nWhen you had a hard time,\\nI tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.\\nHeard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?\\nGo out with him.\\nI thought he\\'d make things easy for you.\\nOh, yeah.\\nGyeon-woo, you\\'re going to England, right?\\nShe\\'s already been there, so she can give you some tips.\\nI do not have to go now.\\nWhy?\\nYou two know each other?\\nYou may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.\\nFrom your future.\\nThis is how I met her again.\\nThink it\\'s too coincidental?\\nIt\\'s building a bridge of chance for your love.\\nPresented by IM Pictures\\nProduced by Shin Cine\\nIn association with MVP Venture Capital and Cinema Service\\nJeun Jee-hyun Cha

the service, I worked in a theme park.\\nSo this is my plan.\\nAt midnight, I will be alone with her in the park.\\nIt will be completely dark all around us.\\nOne by one, the lights to the merry-go-round flick on.\\nI raise my arms up there, and her birthday song starts.\\nThen all the lights turn on and it moves.\\nThere\\'s fireworks, too.\\nIs not it fantastic?\\nShe will be thrilled.\\nI gave 200,000 won to my friends working there.\\n- Jump over here?\\n- Yeah.\\nWe have to.\\nI always wanted to come here at night.\\nIt\\'s my birthday, not yours.\\nPlease, let\\'s just try.\\nI will go up first and help you.\\nEh?\\nThere\\'s a step here.\\nTake my hand.\\nOh, shit!\\nShit!\\nGyeon-woo.\\nHey!\\nAnswer me.\\nI am leaving.\\nI am leaving.\\nAnswer

loud, I will kill you.\\nGot it?\\nYes.\\n- Answer quietly!\\n- Yes.\\nIs that a real gun?\\n- Wanna see?\\n- Forget it.\\nHow are you two related?\\nWe\\'re just friends.\\nReally?\\nYou mean she could be my pussy?\\nWhat?\\nYour pussy?\\nI am not a cat or anything!\\nGo ahead and apologize!\\nAlright.\\nI will do it.\\nI am sorry.\\nAnyway, friends come here late at night?\\nWhy are you here?\\nWe just wanted to come here at night.\\n- Tell me the truth, idiot.\\n- Nothing special.\\nBullshit.\\nWhat makes you trust a guy like him?\\nI trusted myself.\\nI had a girlfriend, too.\\nShe visited me every week for one year.\\nI was so happy.\\nBut that bitch fell in love with the guard house sergeant.\\nI found out the fact after he was discharged.\\nDamn it.\\nWhile I am in the service, even my dog... ran away with some mutt, too.\\nMy Yorkshire terrier.\\nBitch.\\nFuck.\\nI came out to kill both bitches.\\nFuck.\\nI have the worst luck in this world.\\nDamn it.\\nKnow what special day is it today?\\nHuh, damn it?\\nThis sucks!\\nHey, what are the odds to meet a runaway soldier in a park?\\nDo not know.\\nHeard your head blows up if you shoot in the mouth.\\nYeah, the hole in your head is this big.\\nThat\\'s serious.\\nA teeny bullet does that?\\nYeah, the bullet tears the...\\nHey!\\nWhat are you two doing?\\nStop joking around.\\nDamn it.\\nDamn it!\\nEven you bastards ignore me.\\n- That\\'s why you should not be foolish.\\n- Why?\\nAm I foolish?\\nEven if you do this, she will not come back.\\nI know.\\nI know, too.\\nBut if I die, she will be heartbroken.\\nShe will never be the same.\\nYou\\'re wrong.\\nThe pain goes away sooner than you think.\\nYou went through something like this?\\nYeah.\\nIt happens that way.\\nDamn it.\\nIf I am caught, I will go to the can.\\nI will always think of her there.\\nWhat does \"can\" mean?\\nIt means prison.\\n- Do not interrupt.\\n- Sorry.\\nAnyway, you\\'re responsible for your actions now.\\nExcuse me, sir.\\nHow about letting her go?\\nIf I say no?\\nThen let me go, instead.\\nCome to think of it, your eyebrows remind me of that sergeant.\\nYou act like him, too.\\nYou can go.\\nAnd you...\\nWe die together.\\nGot it?\\nPardon?\\nHey, lady.\\nForget about this bastard, and look for a nice guy.\\nGot it?\\n- Go!\\n- Let\\'s go together.\\nAll three of us.\\nWill you leave if I kill him?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nDo not worry too much.\\nThis soldier is not a bad guy.\\nYou will come out safely.\\nYou\\'re leaving me alone?\\nThere\\'s no other way.\\nI was afraid to die alone, but I am glad we\\'re in it together.\\nOh, right.\\nOver there, there\\'s an exit near the merry-go-round.\\nNobody knows about it.\\nI used to work here.\\nReally?\\nYou\\'re not tricking me, right?\\nI am a man, too.\\nWhy would I?\\nWalk in front of me.\\nSee?\\nI told you so.\\nThis way!\\nShit!\\nWhat\\'s going on?\\nIt\\'s Gyeon-woo.\\nScrew you!\\nDo not come closer!\\nI will kill him!\\nI will really kill him!\\nTell that bitch to come!\\nSo she can see me die!\\nI will give you an hour!\\nIf not, I will kill him, and myself, too!\\n- Got it?\\n- Hurry up!\\nSniper 2!\\nThe hostage is in danger, but we can still fire.\\nDo not!\\nWait!\\nDo not shoot!\\nHey, soldier!\\nI mean... sir!\\nYour girlfriend changed her mind, right?\\nDid you really love her?\\nAsk yourself.\\nI think you did not.\\nIf you really love her, you should let her go.\\nIf not, then it\\'s not love.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with someone you do not love getting married?\\nStop this, and go back to the base as a real man.\\nA person like you should learn more about love.\\nIf we want to learn, then we should keep living.\\nDamn it.\\nShe\\'s the nicest girl I have met.\\nHey!\\nDo not let her go.\\nGot it?\\nIf you do, I will take her.\\n- Can I go?\\n- Go.\\nScrew it.\\nShit!\\nDo not know.\\nThank you.\\nToday\\'s my birthday.\\nI will live on until I learn what love is.\\nWhat?\\nWe\\'re just friends?\\nNo, I said that to save you.\\n\"Let me go, instead?\"\\nWanted to save yourself, huh?\\nHe would not have let you go.\\nStop lying!\\nStop lying!\\nStop lying!\\nHave a nice life alone.\\nI screwed up her birthday, but I feel good anyway.\\n\\'Cause I am proud to be with her, and things turned out as planned.\\nI hope you believe in me.\\nYou can not?\\nWait...\\nSecond Half\\nI remember.\\nShe always came with him until last year.\\nWas it last spring or winter?\\nOne day, she came alone with flowers to ask a favor.\\nTo not let anyone sit in his seat that day.\\nWhat\\'s up?\\nOh, hi.\\nYou\\'re early.\\nI was in the neighborhood.\\nMiss me?\\nOf course!\\nShe always tried hard to look cheery.\\n- I like her that way.\\n- What would you like?\\nCoke, please.\\nWanna die?\\nDrink coffee.\\nTwo coffees, please.\\nI know her.\\nShe pretends to be happy, but she\\'s full of sorrow inside.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nWhat are you smiling at?\\nNo.\\nIt\\'s nothing.\\nLooks fun, huh?\\n- Another one?\\n- Why?\\nDo not wanna read it?\\nShe may get disappointed, but I should be honest for her sake.\\nLooks fun.\\nI will read it.\\nThis time it\\'s a martial arts film.\\nThe heroine is a bounty hunter.\\nThe villain wears rain slippers even on clear days.\\nThe worst of his kind.\\nWhat happened?\\nHis name\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nGyeon-woo?\\nThe story\\'s setting is a mess.\\nJapan invades during King Sejong\\'s reign, and the King\\'s father is the tyrant Yeonsan.\\nIn the end, the heroine fights the villain in a field.\\nHeavy rain pours down on a sunny day.\\nYup!\\nThe heroine becomes a King.\\nKing Jung-jo.\\nShe\\'s from the future, of course.\\nIt\\'s fun, huh?\\nWhy is the heroine always from the future?\\nScience is advanced by then, so they invent a time machine.\\nAnd people go to the past to travel.\\nPeople from the future could be here now.\\nI think UFOs are time machines.\\nSomeday, I will meet someone from the future.\\nI have to.\\nIf you do, ask him to take you.\\nWhat?\\nIf it\\'s possible...\\nGive this to Shin Cine.\\nTell them to cast Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha.\\nJeon Do-yun is okay, too.\\nExcuse me, we talked on the phone, right?\\nWell... this is \"The Warrior\\'s Sad Love Story\"...\\nIt\\'s going to be a hit.\\nShin Cine did not... call back.\\nHey!\\nHey, kid.\\nIs the subway your sketch book?\\nDo not scribble on it.\\nWanna die?\\nMy lipstick!\\nI always take her home, even to Bupyung station.\\nIt\\'s something a man must do.\\nOn the way, we play fun games, too.\\nLeft foot over the line, I win.\\nWith the right foot, you win.\\nWhat\\'s the prize?\\nLet\\'s see...\\nHow about a kiss?\\nA kiss?\\nWanna die?\\nYou choose.\\nHitting each other.\\nAgain?\\nYou can hit me, too.\\nOkay.\\nSomeone\\'s coming.\\nI think this is unfair.\\nI am a girl, so I will slap the cheek.\\nNo.\\nThen I will change it, too.\\n- But I am a girl.\\n- Men and women are equal.\\nOkay, then.\\nYou slap, and I slap, too.\\nGo easy on me, and I will kill you.\\nBetter slap me on the cheek.\\nIf you do not, I will kill you!\\nAll right.\\nYou slap, and I will use my finger.\\nRight, that\\'s fair.\\nSaw that?\\nSee that guy step over with his left foot?\\nI had my eyes closed.\\nPlus he came the opposite way.\\nI thought it was this way.\\nShut up.\\nHere they come.\\nLeft foot.\\nLeft foot.\\nIt will be the right foot.\\nLeft!\\nLeft!\\nSwitch to the right.\\nYou have to hit me?\\nYou know why the sky is blue?\\n\\'Cause the reflection of the sunshine.\\nNope.\\nIt\\'s for me!\\nI want it to be blue.\\nSo, it\\'s blue.\\nYou know why the fire is hot?\\nIt\\'s all for me.\\nI want it to be hot.\\nSo it is.\\nYou know why we have four seasons here in Korea?\\n- Because of you.\\n- That\\'s correct!\\nAnd why you were born here?\\n- It\\'s for me as well.\\n- What?\\nThat\\'s nonsense.\\nI was born before you.\\nYou know the word \"worship\"?\\n\"Peter came first in order to prepare for the birth of Jesus,\" huh?\\nWell...\\nYeah, I know.\\nSo, get ready!\\nCome here.\\nStay still.\\nWhen I am with her,\\nI never know how the day will turn out.\\nWhat?\\nWhat are you looking at?\\nI quit!\\nIs your face a racket?\\nWhy does the ball always hit my face?\\nIt\\'s strange.\\nI never want to lose a game.\\nSo I play until I win.\\nWait long?\\nJust a teeny bit.\\nMy mom bought me these heels, but they\\'re killing my feet.\\nWant a massage?\\nNo, it\\'s okay.\\nInstead, let\\'s exchange shoes.\\nDo not wanna?\\nHow can a guy wear heels?\\nIt will fit.\\nBut, I can not...\\nYeah?\\nI see.\\nCome on.\\nI will buy you some sneakers.\\nForget it.\\nThen wear mine, and I will carry yours.\\nYou do not understand women.\\nOkay!\\nLet\\'s exchange.\\nReally?\\nWanna know a secret?\\nWhat is it?\\nI do not wear panties on exam day.\\nBut I had one today.\\nCatch me, honey!\\nHey.\\nIf you do not, I will kill you.\\n- Phew...\\n- Catch me, honey...!\\nStop right there!\\nStop!\\nOut!\\nIt was just a second, but I felt something in her eyes.\\nThat\\'s my house.\\nWait.\\nI will bring you an umbrella.\\nI am okay.\\nI am already wet so I will just leave.\\nEh?\\nGee...\\nAre you my daughter\\'s boyfriend?\\nYes, sir.\\nHow much do you know about my daughter?\\nNot much...\\nNext time, do not hang out till late.\\nYou do not understand me.\\nWhy\\'d you stand him up?\\nWhat\\'s wrong with him?\\nWhy do you stand guys up?\\nAnd what happened to your heels?\\nWhat\\'s wrong with you?\\nI told you not to meet Gyeon-woo.\\nHe\\'s dumb and has no future.\\nIt\\'s none of your business.\\nWhy is he stupid?\\nYou\\'re stupid so you do not know.\\nWhat has gotten into you?\\nLet me live my own life!\\nAfterwards,\\nI did not hear from her for a long time.\\n- Hello?\\n- Gyeon-woo, it\\'s me.\\nLong time no see.\\nHer voice sounds cheerful as if nothing happened to her.\\nOur 100th day celebration is soon.\\nIt\\'s 100 days already?\\nWhen do you think a girl\\'s the prettiest?\\nWhen a sexy woman is naked.\\nWhere are you now?\\nStay right there.\\nNo, I am just kidding.\\nThe prettiest is when she\\'s playing the piano.\\nWhat\\'s your favorite song?\\nThat George Winston song.\\nPachelbel Canon?\\nYeah, that song.\\nYou\\'re not gonna ask me?\\nWhen is the guy the prettiest?\\nJust give me a rose.\\nStill have your high school uniform?\\nYeah.\\nWhy?\\nBring it on our 100th day, and give me a rose during my class.\\nDo it yourself, okay?\\nWhat?\\nWhat did you say?\\nHow can I during class?\\nHey!\\nJust hung up on me!\\nDamn it!\\nI do not wanna get beaten by her, or get humiliated at a women\\'s college.\\nOh, my God!\\nA burglar!\\nHelp, a burglar!\\nEh?\\nAre you crazy?\\nYou\\'re gonna break into where?\\nWhat on Earth are you doing in broad daylight?\\nAnd you...\\nWhy you did not drop by your aunt\\'s, coming and going to Bupyung for the girl?\\nYou never know how much hard time I went through for you.\\nShe even intends to introduce a girl to you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nWhere are you going?\\nI am cleverer than I look.\\nThese girls sure love Chinese food.\\nHey, you!\\nWhere you headed?\\nCome here!\\nI am delivering Chinese food.\\nI ordered it.\\nBring it here.\\nReally?\\nBring a lot of radish?\\nOh, I forgot something!\\nGive me the food first!\\nThat\\'s the wrong way!\\nThere\\'s another customer.\\nHey!\\nBut that was not enough for her.\\nWe relived our old high school days.\\nDrink!\\nDrink till die!\\nI have never had anything like this.\\nGee!\\nSorry, I am gonna drink it in my way.\\nFeeling so good!\\nHave a smoke, too!\\nWow, I have never had a smoke, either!\\nGonna be a big deal.\\nI do not smoke well...\\nWhat are we supposed to do if caught by teacher?\\nIt\\'s a suspension!\\nYou have already had your ups and downs in life.\\nNot to worry.\\nGo ahead and smoke!\\nHey, you are such a tough cookie!\\nYou go to a very good school!\\nThese clothes are so tight!\\nAfter we visited that club, a school uniform party was held every month.\\nBut she got wasted again.\\nOh, wild teens!\\nHere\\'s a condom.\\nLet\\'s prevent AIDS.\\nTaxi!\\nShe\\'s having a happy dream.\\nCompared to when I looked at her in the motel the first time, she looks so different.\\nCould her pain be cured now?\\nMaybe it means that she does not need me anymore.\\nExcuse me.\\nCan you drive slowly?\\nHere.\\nHave any plans after graduation?\\nActually, I have never thought about it yet.\\nCan I see what\\'s in your pocket?\\nSir?\\nRight.\\nIt\\'s a condom.\\nWhat is this for?\\nOh, right.\\nI learned that it prevents AIDS.\\nBut I have not used it yet.\\n- Actually, on the way here.\\n- Forget it.\\n\"Chicks Hen\"?\\nWhat does this mean?\\nOh, right.\\nIt\\'s a chicken soup restaurant.\\n\"We will satisfy all your wishes?\"\\nI think it\\'s to satisfy our tastes.\\n\"Hurry and tell him.\"\\nHow do feel about our daughter?\\nOh, right.\\nWe\\'re just friends now.\\nPlease, do not worry.\\nIf we get closer, I will let you know, sir.\\nDo not see her any more.\\nAfter that day, she never calls me.\\nIt was sudden, but that\\'s how we broke up.\\nWe have broken up.\\nNow, I am free.\\nIt\\'s me.\\nCome to the cafe by seven o\\'clock.\\nWhy?\\nWhat?\\nI have a blind date today.\\nCome in 45 minutes.\\nI have a blind date, too.\\nAre you on your way?\\nI am on a date with a girl.\\nHurry up.\\nI have to go to the bathroom.\\n\"Gotta go to the bathroom.\"\\nEh?\\nNice to meet you.\\nI am Cha Seok-won.\\nNice to meet you.\\n- Same here.\\n- Have a seat.\\nWere you really with a girl?\\nNo, I was with a guy.\\nCan I take your order?\\nCoffee, please.\\nYou can drink coke.\\nI will drink coffee.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou\\'re very lucky.\\nI heard a lot about you.\\nThat you\\'re a close friend.\\nFriend...\\nI need to go to the bathroom.\\nHow is he?\\nNo idea... but he looks nice.\\nHe is not the man you broke up with, is he?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhen you see a new man...\\nForget about the past, all right?\\nHow the hell do you know?\\nThis necklace was given to you from your ex-boyfriend, is not it?\\nYou would not wear it, if you just broke up for nothing.\\nConsidering your temper... and you... used to say that you could not get over him.\\nDoes that mean he is not here anymore in this world.\\nThat man is the one my mom introduced to me.\\nShe kept pushing me to meet him...\\nDoes not look bad, does he?\\nYes.\\nHey, listen!\\nI am totally okay, but you should be obedient to a man.\\nA man likes something more feminine.\\nAnd... do not drink a lot.\\nSome of the guys target intoxicated girls.\\nAnd it\\'s all right with me, but to the other guys... try to surrender just for once do not try to win.\\nGood luck to you.\\nWhere\\'s Gyeon-woo?\\nHe left already.\\nHe told me ten rules to follow.\\nI have a good memory.\\nI will recite them.\\nFirst, do not ask her to be feminine.\\nAnd do not...\\nSecond, do not let her drink over three glasses.\\nShe will beat someone.\\nAt a cafe, drink coffee instead of coke or juice.\\nIf she hits you, act like it hurts.\\nIf it hurts, act like it does not.\\nOn your 100th day together, give her a rose during her class.\\nShe will like it a lot.\\nMake sure you learn fencing and squash.\\nAlso, be prepared to go to prison sometimes.\\nIf she says she will kill you... do not take it lightly.\\nYou will feel better.\\nIf her feet hurts, exchange shoes with her.\\nFinally, she likes to write.\\nEncourage her.\\nLadies and gentlemen, please, pay attention...\\nGyeon-woo.\\nStep back behind the yellow line...\\nGyeon-woo!\\nafter passengers getting off, take in order...\\nGyeon-woo!\\n...please, use the next train.\\nWhat\\'s his name?\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI will do it myself.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nWhere are you?\\nI looked all over for you.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nCome to the escalator.\\nOkay?\\nYou\\'re dead if you do not.\\nHurry up.\\nWho told you to hug me?\\nDummy.\\nYou\\'re supposed to dodge.\\nSometimes I feel like I know her and sometimes I do not.\\nWe\\'re definitely standing at the crossroad now.\\nWhat\\'s going on between us?\\nCan this relationship last forever?\\nWho is it?\\nIt\\'s me, dad.\\nShe told me to write a letter and bring it.\\nTo write it on paper.\\nTo express my feelings,\\nI tried hard to find the right words.\\nWhen I first met her,\\nI wanted to cure her grief, but now I can not give her up.\\nI wish we can get serious.\\nI am writing about these feelings.\\nShe\\'s probably writing about me now.\\nThis is how we\\'re preparing to split up.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nSee that mountain top?\\nYeah.\\nCould someone hear me from there?\\nYes, probably so.\\nOr probably not.\\nThen go over there.\\nI will shout here.\\nIf you hear, answer me.\\nYou want me to go over there?\\nYeah.\\nGyeon-woo?\\nCan you hear me?\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI am sorry.\\nI really can not help it.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nI am sorry.\\nI am sorry...\\nI can not help it.\\nI thought I was different, but I am just a helpless girl.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nI am sorry.\\nDid you bring your letter?\\nYeah.\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nA time capsule.\\nWe put our letters in it and bury it here.\\nAnd two years later, let\\'s meet here again.\\nWe will read the letters that day, and maybe we can find an answer then.\\nThis was her way of saying good-bye, and I kept repeating in my mind that two years is not long.\\nLet\\'s open this exactly two years later, at two.\\nOkay?\\nWe can meet two years later.\\nWhen we meet then, we will be different from what we are now.\\nWe may become closer, or stay forever apart.\\nWe can only choose one.\\nGyeon-woo.\\nYou go first.\\nLet\\'s separate here.\\nShould we go together?\\nNo, I will take the next train.\\nI think that\\'s better.\\nSee you two years later!\\nOkay, in two years!\\nTwo years!\\nBye!\\nGyeon-woo!\\nThat\\'s how we broke up.\\nOvertime\\nI could not endure the loneliness after we broke up.\\nThinking of those memories,\\nI started to write about our stories on the Internet.\\nThen I made up my mind.\\nIf I meet her again, I will show her a different me.\\nGot to make use of my time.\\nFor her and my future\\'s sake.\\nWhy does the ball I hit keep hitting my face?\\nI wrote our stories on the Internet everyday, and I kept myself busy for two years.\\nYup!\\nExcuse me.\\nI wrote \"My Sassy Girl\".\\nShin Cine saw my writing, and offered to make a movie out of it.\\nI made her dream come true instead.\\nI wanted to tell her right away, but I can only wait till that day.\\nShe did not come.\\nIt\\'s our only day to meet.\\nNo one knows when she will come.\\nWow!\\nHow did he get in here?\\nIt\\'s a mystery.\\nGyeon-woo!\\nHow are you?\\nI was so happy while being with you.\\nI am not sure if you knew, but the person I loved passed away.\\nThe day when I first met you was the day he died a year before.\\nActually, I tried to look for him in you.\\nI know it was wrong.\\nI am sorry.\\nI also met him on the subway like you.\\nI was really sick at that time.\\nHe did everything I wanted.\\nLike you did to me.\\nUnder this tree, we planned our future together.\\nBut he suddenly passed away.\\nWhile I was dating you, I met his mother often.\\nShe wanted to introduce a nice man to me, but I could not.\\nThe day I first met you, I came under this tree, and I prayed to him.\\nTo let me free.\\nWhen I met you, this occurred to me.\\nThat maybe... he introduced you to me.\\nBut the more I met you, he seemed to grow jealous of you in me.\\nThe more I liked you, I felt guilty inside.\\nWhile the two of us are apart,\\nI want to forget him alone.\\nAfter that day, I went often to this place.\\nIf I am not with you after two years, it means I still lack of courage.\\nHow much will we change after two years?\\nI feel like you live in the future, and I stay in the past.\\nI want to meet you soon, so I can read your letter.\\nWhy are you staring at me, sir?\\nBecause you\\'re so pretty.\\nI thought an angel came down.\\nDo you come here often?\\nSometimes.\\nThis tree has a secret.\\nI have a secret here, too.\\nReally?\\nThree years ago, I buried a letter here with my boyfriend.\\nWhat\\'s your secret?\\nSo what happened?\\nWe promised to read the letters a year ago.\\nBut I could not come.\\nI guess you\\'re a year late.\\nBut two years did not seem that long.\\nI have not made any decision yet.\\nI just wasted my time on stupid thoughts.\\nLike what?\\nIf we were destined to meet,\\nI thought we\\'d meet by chance somewhere.\\nKnow what fate is?\\nBuilding a bridge of chance for someone you love.\\nTo be honest, I read you guys letters.\\nI said this tree had a secret, right?\\nYes.\\nLook closely.\\nDoes this tree look the same as before?\\nWell, it looks like it changed a bit.\\nBut I am not sure.\\nPeople are dead or alive.\\nThere\\'s a dead tree and a living tree, too.\\nThis tree was struck dead by lightning last year.\\nIt was split into two.\\nBut this young man felt sorry for it.\\nDuring this Spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.\\nWhen he planted the tree, he asked me if it looked the same.\\nHe said that someone would be sad if it died, so no one should know.\\nGyeon-woo...\\nYou call a wrong number or the dial is not in service.\\nPlease, call again.\\nHi.\\nIt\\'s been a while.\\nYou have gotten prettier.\\nYou still look young.\\nHow have you been?\\nYou were in England?\\nYes.\\nFor one and a half years.\\nSo I can forget him.\\nI see.\\nFeel better?\\nYes.\\nA lot better.\\nIs it true now?\\nMy son might be sad.\\nHe will not.\\nHe will like it this way.\\nGood, that\\'s what I really hoped.\\nAuntie!\\nI was getting my photo taken.\\nYou naughty boy.\\nKnow how long it\\'s been?\\nSorry I did not tell you before.\\nThis is Gyeon-woo.\\nDoes not he resemble him?\\nWhen you had a hard time,\\nI tried to introduce you to him for several years, but he kept getting out of it.\\nHeard you came to Bupyung often, but you never visited me?\\nGo out with him.\\nI thought he\\'d make things easy for you.\\nOh, yeah.\\nGyeon-woo, you\\'re going to England, right?\\nShe\\'s already been there, so she can give you some tips.\\nI do not have to go now.\\nWhy?\\nYou two know each other?\\nYou may not believe it, but I think I met a man from the future.\\nFrom your future.\\nThis is how I met her again.\\nThink it\\'s too coincidental?\\nIt\\'s building a bridge of chance for your love.\\nPresented by IM Pictures\\nProduced by Shin Cine\\nIn association with MVP Venture Capital and Cinema Service\\nJeun Jee-hyun Cha
