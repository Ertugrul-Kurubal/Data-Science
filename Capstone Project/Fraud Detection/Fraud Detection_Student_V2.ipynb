Each node is a perceptron and is similar to a multiple linear regression. The perceptron feeds the signal produced by a multiple linear regression into an activation function that may be nonlinear.\n","\n","In a multi-layered perceptron (MLP), perceptrons are arranged in interconnected layers. The input layer collects input patterns. The output layer has classifications or output signals to which input patterns may map. \n","\n","Hidden layers fine-tune the input weightings until the neural networkâ€™s margin of error is minimal. It is hypothesized that hidden layers extrapolate salient features in the input data that have predictive power regarding the outputs.\n","\n","You will discover **[how to create](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-our-first-neural-network-in-keras-bdc8abbc17f5)** your deep learning neural network model in Python using **[Keras](https://keras.io/about/)**.

Model Deployement\r\n","You cooked the food in the kitchen and moved on to the serving stage. The question is how do you showcase your work to others? Model Deployement helps you showcase your work to the world and make better decisions with it. But, deploying a model can get a little tricky at times. Before deploying the model, many things such as data storage, preprocessing, model building and monitoring need to be studied.\r\n","\r\n","Deployment of machine learning models, means making your models available to your other business systems. By deploying models, other systems can send data to them and get their predictions, which are in turn populated back into the company systems. Through machine learning model deployment, can begin to take full advantage of the model you built.\r\n","\r\n","Data science is concerned with how to build machine learning models, which algorithm is more predictive, how to design features, and what variables to use to make the models more accurate. However, how these models are actually used is often neglected. And yet this is the most important step in the machine learning pipline.
